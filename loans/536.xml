From this work, Jennifer and Joseph earn an estimated minimum of Php700 per day.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To help her grow her business, Jennifer would like to request for a Php9,000 loan. She will use this money to buy spare parts (such as tires) to maintain their tricycle units.  She will also use part of this loan to purchase other materials needed for their cycle repair business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jennifer does not emphasize any challenges encountered in her life but rather focuses on solutions and acts on them.  Living a simple and practical life, she wants a strong family foundation and an active spiritual life.  She prays that in God&apos;s time, they will be blessed with their own baby.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As CCT community partner, she faithfully attends their weekly fellowship* meeting, where she can also gain strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*All CCT community partners/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The group buys and sells clothing, condiments, fruit and vegetables, and sugar.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To expand their businesses, the group members decided two years ago to joint the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. They are now on their third group loan. And the previous ones have been repaid properly.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Djeneba T., who is a member of the group Benkadi, buys and sells condiments of all kinds, such as oil, onions, &lt;i&gt;sounbala&lt;/i&gt; (pounded and fermented seeds or beans), tomatoes, Maggie bouillon cubes, garlic, spices, etc. She is in high demand because she occupies a good spot at the Hamdallaye market. She intends to use her loan to buy a large quantity of condiments. She acquires her merchandise wholesale at the big market of Koutiala and sells retail, accepting cash from a customer base comprised essentially of women.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;While the other group members plan on making an average profit of 105,000 francs CFA over the course of each cycle, Djeneba T. plans on making 120,000 francs.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In addition to making loan payments, the group members envision using a portion of the revenues for coping with common family expenses.

She has been a widow for 18 years, and raised her five children (who are all married now) alone.  As a mother, she always work very hard to provide for the daily needs of her family. At present, Leonora lives in Baseco Port Area, Manila.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Being in the direct-selling business, Leonora has developed the skill to choose quality products and deal with people in the neighborhood to turn them into regular customers. She mainly sells household products like kitchen wares, accessories, cosmetics, and the like.  At this time, Leonora is trying to maintain her good reputation, which gained her the trust of her management.  Monthly,she earns an average net income of Php10,800.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Leonora wants to maximize her potential as a multi-tasking entrepreneur. To help her do that and grow her businesses, she would like to request a Php24,000 loan. She plans to use this amount into increase the number of products she sells in order to better meet the specific needs of her regular customers. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Certainly, Leonora has her share of customers who do not pay on time. Nevertheless, she still prays for the ability to collect their payments and prays for God&apos;s blessings for those customers.  Being six years in this kind of business, Leonora has received awards and recognition from her company for being a top performer for three consecutive years. Because of this, she is inspired to give this business all her best.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Leonora believes that everything can be possible through hard work and strong faith in God.  As CCT community partner, she faithfully attends to their weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*All CCT community partners/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>701084</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home

Her business is located at the busy Kibuye market in Kisumu. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mary has been in business for 10 years now, and has managed to give employment to two people. Her business is profitable, but her major challenge is lack of enough storage space for her end products. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She plans to use her loan of 80,000 Kenyan shillings to buy timber to make more items due to the high demand by her customers. She sees herself growing the business and becoming the market leader in the furniture-making business. She describes herself as very honest and God-fearing.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>997.3</paid_amount><image><id>701089</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Furniture

Her business is located in the town of Kakamega, which is in the region in Kenya known as the sugarbelt region for the production of sugarcane. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mary sells groceries to the local residents. She has been in this business for 18 years now and has employed one person. She says that this business is profitable and the only major challenge she has is that there are very many people in the area with the same kind of business as hers, hence customers are spoiled for choice. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is using her loan of 20,000 Kenyan shillings to buy tomatoes and onions to grow her business and meet the demands of her customers. In the future, she hopes to grow her business into a wholesale one. She describes herself as humble, intelligent and

She is married and has three children aged 18, 15 and 4. She has one additional dependent who lives with her because she assists with her schooling. In 1998, Mbalu established her baby clothing business. She began her business because she wanted to be self reliant. Working seven days a week and ten hours a day, she earns about Le 2,028,000 every month. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000 in order to buy additional baby items. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 405,600. In the future, Mbalu plans to educate her children and to have a house of her own. She thanks you for your

O. is a 32-year-old married man. His wife is a student at a local college and they do not have any children yet. Victor sells mangoes, oranges and other fruits. His business is located at Kakamega, a region in Kenya commonly referred to as the sugarbelt and known for the production of sugarcane.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He has been in this business for the last two years. This business is profitable for him but his major challenge is the fact that fruits are seasonal and thus, there are some seasons within the year when there is not much business due to unavailability of fruits. However, he works very hard from early to late evening to keep his business doing well.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He is requesting a loan of 40,000 Kenyan shillings to buy mangoes to grow his business and meet customer demand. He hopes to grow his business and stock vegetables, which he will be selling wholesale. He also hopes to purchase a plot of land and put up rental houses. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Victor describes himself as

His wife is a business lady and they have three children, ages 8 to 2 years old. Henry sells mangoes, oranges and other fruits. His business is located in Kakamega – a region in Kenya known for the production of sugarcane and commonly referred to as the sugar belt region. He has been in his business for the last three years. This business is profitable for him but his major challenge is the fact that fruits are seasonal. There are some seasons during the year when there is not much business due to unavailability of fruits. He also does not have a fridge, so some fruits rot leaving him with a loss. Nevertheless, he works very hard from early in the day to late evening to keep his business doing well. &#10;&#10;Henry is requesting a loan of 40,000 Kenyan shillings to buy mangoes to expand his business and meet customer demand. He hopes to grow his business and stock vegetables, which he will be selling wholesale. He also hopes to purchase a plot of land and put up rental houses. Henry describes himself as

Esta emprendedora dama se dedica a la venta de peluches y productos de belleza durante sus ratos libres; pues paralelamente se desempeña como obrera en una fabrica. Le gustan mucho sus labores pues le proporcionan el dinero suficiente para brindarle a su familia una buena calidad de vida. Lo que no le gusta es que debe pasar mucho tiempo fuera de su vivienda, y debe dejar a su pequeña al cuidado de su madre, pero sabe que ella la cuida con mucha dedicación. Como es una joven empeñosa tiene planeado instalar una tienda en su casa para que su madre la atienda, de esta manera espera mejorar sus ganancias. Es el primer crédito que tiene con MFP y promete pagar sus cuotas puntualmente, pues no quiere quedar mal con las personas que hicieron posible este aporte que le permitirá continuar trabajando para cumplir con sus metas. Julia tiene planeado invertir el crédito solicitado en la compra de materiales de construcción que necesita para terminar de construir su casa, pues quiere empezar a concretar el anhelo de la tienda. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Julia, age 24, lives in her mother’s house with her mother and her young daughter.

She needs to leave her little one in her mother’s care.  However, she knows that her mother takes care of her daughter with much devotion.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As she is a hard-working woman, she plans to set up a store in her house that her mother will take care of.  This way she hopes to improve their income.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is her first loan with MFP, and she pledges to make her payments on time.  She does not want to disappoint the people who made this loan possible.  The loan will allow her to continue working to meet her goals.

She earns her living by buying and selling dry goods. Her husband, Basmala, who is 42 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife&apos;s business activities. They have 10 children who are from 2 to 22 years old. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Gina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 21 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,500 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This time, for her 23rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy more stock of dry goods to sell at the market so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Gina is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About NWTF:  &lt;/b&gt;In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The loan will be used to purchase various natural products. She has outstanding orders, but lacks the capital to fill them. In this way, she hopes to increase her earnings.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>375</funded_amount><paid_amount>375</paid_amount><image><id>701190</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Natural Medicines</activity><sector>Health</sector><use>Purchase natural products for sale</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Lima</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-12.05 -77.05</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-27T15:10:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>375</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maria </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2011-01-25T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>375</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>143.47</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>156.42</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>165.94</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170.91</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-07-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>177.98</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-08-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>185.28</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>53.8</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.66</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.23</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>64.09</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>66.74</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-10-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>69.48</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>53.8</amount><local_amount>143.47</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-15T11:36:37Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>149.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201327627</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.66</amount><local_amount>156.42</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T11:32:48Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>162.54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206196162</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.23</amount><local_amount>165.94</local_amount><processed_date>2011-05-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-06-15T11:41:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>172.43</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>211269839</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>64.09</amount><local_amount>170.91</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T11:32:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>177.6</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216549857</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>66.74</amount><local_amount>177.98</local_amount><processed_date>2011-07-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-08-15T09:13:07Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>184.94</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>221718512</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>69.48</amount><local_amount>185.28</local_amount><processed_date>2011-08-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-09-17T08:14:04Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>192.53</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>227350000</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-27T16:53:34Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-09-17T08:14:04Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>268633</id><name>Norma</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Norma, tiene 27 años de edad y tiene su pareja, ella vive junto con su pareja en la ciudad del Cusco, Perú.

She thanks you for your support. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Whether on the streets of Kathmandu or in the villages outside of the capital, tea shops are places of business and meeting in Nepal. Called a &lt;i&gt;chiya pasal&lt;/i&gt;, these tea shops make a sweet, milky tea that can be purchased for a few cents a cup. With a Kiva loan, BPW&apos;s borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This loan was administered by Kiva&apos;s local partner MFI (microfinance institution), Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva&apos;s first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business-training programs to low-income women.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Liloan, Santander, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, videoke rental and fish vending. Her husband, Antonio M., Jr., is 51 years old and works as a pumpboat captain to earn his living. He also helps with his wife&apos;s business activities. They have five children who are from 14 to 24 years old; two of her children have their own families and one is currently going to school. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Grace joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Grace has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy stock for the store and as a down payment for a new motorcycle.

She earns her living by fishing. Her husband, Mario L. Jr., is 27 years old and works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife&apos;s business activities. They have two children who are 1 and 5 years old. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Myrene joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Myrene has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 11,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,000, thus uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Myrene is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About NWTF:  &lt;/b&gt;In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Bonifacio is a 33-year-old single man who supports his family by operating two business ventures: seaweed culturing and fishing. He lives in Bantayan, Cebu. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bonifacio joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because he aspired for something better for his family. With the help of his past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bonifacio has been incrementally lifting his family out of poverty by the sweat of his brow. His previous loan of 11,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped him earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This time, for his 10th loan, he is borrowing PHP 11,000, which he intends to use to buy fishing gear and equipment so that he can continue to save up for the future expansion of his business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bonifacio is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) man who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of his dreams.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About NWTF: &lt;/b&gt;In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married and has two children, aged 30 and 26.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2007, she established her cow-raising business. Working seven days a week and three hours a day, she supports her family.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy a young, milk-giving cow.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the future, Saraswati plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Dairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This loan was administered by Kiva&apos;s local partner MFI (microfinance institution), Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva&apos;s first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business-training programs to low-income women.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Su rostro alegre y encantador es sinónimo de su éxito, ya que estar feliz y sentirse tranquila es lo más preciado que tiene. La agricultura es su principal actividad económica, ya tiene 8 años dedicándose a la siembra de flor de gladiolo, arveja, papa y zanahoria. Lo que más le gusta de su trabajo es poder comercializar lo que cosecha, de esa manera tiene la recompensa de tanto esfuerzo. Una vez al mes viaja a la capital del país a comercializar la flor de gladiolo que siembra. Para el futuro está trabajadora mujer desea seguir sembrando en mayores cantidades, por ello ahora comenzará a sembrar papa de la variedad “munición”. Ella pertenece al banco comunal “Picaflores de Patay”, y este es el cuarto crédito que tiene con MFP, donde es una socia responsable, sincera y sobre todo solidaria. Esther muy pronto cosechará flor de gladiolo a puertas de las próximas festividades del país; por ello con el crédito solicitado, comprará varios sacos de abono orgánico, para esparcirlos entre sus sembríos y obtener una buena cosecha. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Esther is a friendly 35 year-old woman.

Because this hard-working woman hopes to continue planting in greater quantities in the future, she is planning to plant a potato variety called “munición”. Esther belongs to the communal bank “Picaflores de Patay” (Hummingbirds of Patay).  This is her fourth loan with MFP, where she is a responsible, sincere and above all else, supportive member.  Very soon Esther will harvest her gladiolus flowers for the approaching national holiday.  With the loan she has requested, she will purchase a number of sacks of organic fertilizer to spread out in her fields to help her obtain a good harvest.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>701203</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Flowers</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To purchase a number of sacks of organic fertilizer.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>TARMA</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-11.419722 -75.690833</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-27T17:10:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Esther </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2011-01-14T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>2000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-07-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>725</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>725</amount><local_amount>2000</local_amount><processed_date>2011-07-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-08-15T09:13:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2008.97</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>221718513</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-27T19:50:26Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-08-15T09:13:25Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>268645</id><name>Yeabu</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>This is 56 year-old Yeabu.

En armonía familiar ellos viven en su casa propia, ubicada en el caserío de Patay. Ella es muy feliz, todas las mañanas desde las primeras horas de la mañana junto a su esposo Luis, se dirige a sus sembríos de papa, olluco, arvejas y habas, los cuales siembra en sus propios terrenos agrícolas. Su principal ayuda es su esposo, que es su socio también en este trabajo. Tienen 10 años dedicándose a la agricultura y lo que más le gusta de su trabajo es poder pasar la mayor parte de su tiempo en compañía de su familia. Por el desarrollo y éxito de su negocio, desea en adelante ahorrar el crédito suficiente para poder adquirir un camión y de esa manera minimizar los gastos de trasporte que realizan de la ciudad al mercado mayorista de la ciudad, donde lleva a comercializar su cosecha. Ella pertenece al banco comunal “Picaflores de Patay”, y este es el cuarto crédito que tiene con MFP, donde es una socia trabajadora y muy puntual en sus cuotas. Angélica se está preparando para la campaña agrícola, por ello con el crédito comprará semillas de arvejas, asimismo varios sacos de abono orgánico para comenzar sus sembríos de papa y arveja. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Angelica, 36, lives with her husband Luis and their 3 children, whom she loves very much.  The family lives together peacefully in their own home, located in the rural Patay settlement.  She is a cheerful person who works from the earliest hours of the morning with her husband Luis, managing their cultivations of potatoes, olluco (an Andean tuber), peas and beans, which they cultivate on their own lands.  She is helped out mainly by her husband, who is also her partner in this work.  They have been farmers for 10 years, and what they like most about their work is being able to spend most of their time in the company of their family.  For the development and success of their business, they want to save enough so that in the future they will have enough money to buy a truck.  In this way they could minimize the transportation costs associated with taking their harvests to the wholesale market in the city where they go to sell their crops.  She belongs to the communal bank &quot;Picaflores de Patay,&quot; and this is the 4th loan that she has taken with MFP, where she is a hardworking member who is very punctual with her payments.  Angelica is getting ready for the next planting season, and so she will use this loan to buy pea seeds, and also a number of sacks of organic fertilizer so that she can begin planting her potato and pea crops.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>701212</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>to buy pea seeds and sacks of organic fertilizer</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>TARMA</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-11.419722 -75.690833</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-27T18:10:09Z</posted_date><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Angelica </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2011-01-14T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>700</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-07-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>700</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>275</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>275</amount><local_amount>700</local_amount><processed_date>2011-07-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-08-15T09:13:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>762.02</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>221718514</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-27T20:03:38Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-08-15T09:13:44Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>268650</id><name>Leonard</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>This is 33 year-old Leonard.

She is married and has 2 children aged 35 and 30.  In 1995, she established  her vegetable farming business.  Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she suports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 4 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy seeds and fertilizer for farming.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the future, Ishori plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Over 70% of Nepal&apos;s economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW&apos;s borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.

adelante en su casa propia ubicada en el caserío de Patay. A pesar de que su esposo trabaja en otra ciudad y no tiene mayores necesidades, está trabajadora mujer le gusta ser independiente y luchadora. Hace 20 años que se dedica a la agricultura, donde comenzó junto a su esposo a sembrar productos oriundos de la zona como: flor de gladiolo, habas, arvejas y papa; pero hace algunos años Percy, se fue a trabajar fuera de la ciudad, dejando en manos de Nora el cuidado de sus terrenos agrícolas, los que gracias a su buen juicio logró sacar adelante. Una vez al mes viaja a la capital a vender lo que ha cosechado. Por toda la capacidad que está demostrando desea en adelante mejorar sus sembríos y así poder generar mejores ganancias. Ella pertenece al banco comunal “Picaflores de Patay”, y este es el cuarto préstamo que tienen con MFP, donde asume la secretaría de su asociación, siendo una integrante responsable y muy comprometida. Nora muy pronto cosechará habas y papa. Todo el capital que tiene lo invertirá en la fertilización de sus plantaciones para que le den un buen fruto; por ello con el crédito solicitado, comprará una bolsa de semilla de arveja, que esparcirá entre sus sembríos después de la cosecha. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Nora,is a unique, always strong and imposing woman.  She is 43 years old, and, along with her husband Percy, they do well in their own house located in the settlement of Patay.  In spite of the fact that her husband works in another city and she does not have basic necessities, this hard-working woman likes to be independent and a fighter.  For twenty years she has been dedicated to agriculture, which she began along with her husband sowing native products of the zone such as: gladiolus flowers, beans, peas and potatoes.   But some years ago Percy went to work away from the city, leaving the care of their agricultural lands in the hands of Nora. Thanks to her good judgment she managed to move ahead.  Once a month she travels to the capital to sell what she has harvested.  For all the capacity that she is showing she desires to improve her sown fields and thus to be able to generate better profits.  She belongs to the communal bank &quot;Hummingbirds of Patay&quot;, and this is the fourth loan that she has had with MFP, where she assumes the office of the secretary of her association, being a responsible member and very agreeable.  Nora very soon will harvest beans and potatoes.  All the capital that she has will be invested it in the fertilization of her crops so that they give her a good yield.  Because of this she requests a loan to buy a sack of seed for peas which she will spread in her fields after the crop is harvested. </en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>701217</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To buy seeds for peas. </use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>TARMA</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-11.419722 -75.690833</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-28T03:00:06Z</posted_date><loan_amount>200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Nora </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2011-01-14T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-07-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>500</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>500</local_amount><processed_date>2011-07-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-08-15T09:14:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>554.2</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>221718515</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-28T04:56:17Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-08-15T09:14:02Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>268653</id><name>Juana Bautista</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Juana Bautista vive en el barrio carrizal de Barranquilla, en una casa familiar en compañía de su hija que comparte con sus sobrinos.

Juana and her daughter live in a family member&apos;s home that they share with her nieces and nephews.  Juana&apos;s separation from her husband and her immense desire to get herself and her 16 year-old daughter ahead in life, drove her entrepreneurial spirit, with which she has succeeded in setting up businesses that support herself and which will almost certainly allow her to reach her dream of turning her daughter into a successful professional.&#10;&#10;Juana and her daughter currently share a family member&apos;s house with her nieces and nephews.  They live in a small part of the house where, for ten years now, Juana has worked making brooms, floor cloths and brushes.  She learned this trade from a friend who saw that she was having difficulties in making income.  Juana trained and learned how to make her products and also how to run her business and make her own opportunities.  With some savings she had, she was able to buy all the tools and supplies that she needed to carry out her business.&#10;&#10;Juana also started out in another business activity, selling soft drinks, sweet treats and other general snacks.  She now has the basic machinery, tools, chiller cabinet and shelving that she needs to carry out her income-generating business activities.  Through her businesses, she has managed to support her family.  A brother and a nephew help her to make her products and she has also created 10 jobs for other people in her community on whom she relies for her sales in the town of Barranquilla and in the towns of Atlántico and Bolívar departments.&#10;&#10;Juana tells us that her sellers&apos; orders have increased recently and also, during the month of December, her other business selling drinks and snacks saw an upturn in sales.&#10;&#10;This is Juana&apos;s first loan from Fundación Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use this Kiva loan to buy materials for making her products: straw, cotton, wooden bars and cleaning brushes.  Juana&apos;s average monthly sales amount to $1,500,000 Colombian pesos, her profit margin is 50%, her autonomy is 98.9%, her liquidity is 5-1 and her sales are made in cash.  Juana is happy to have her business because she loves serving her customers and she enjoys her productive activity.  She enjoys her work and it keeps her smiling.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>575</funded_amount><paid_amount>575</paid_amount><image><id>701218</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Manufacturing</activity><sector>Manufacturing</sector><use>To

She says they are now starting to bloom. In three months, she will harvest them and sell them in the city of Tarma’s wholesale market. Her future plans are to improve her crops and give her family economic stability. She belongs to the “Los picaflores de Patay” communal bank and this is the fourth credit with MFP.

Desde hace 11 años se dedica a la fabricación de ladrillos, en un inicio trabajaba de manera dependiente en una fábrica de ladrillos, con el tiempo se percato que es más conveniente comprar ladrillos directamente de fabrica y convertirse en distribuidor de este material en la zona donde vive. Aprovechando además que su esposo sabe del negocio por que también trabaja en este rubro y tiene muchos contactos para poder ofrecer el producto; de esta manera ambos distribuyen su tiempo, solo que ella se dedica medio día en este trabajo para tener tiempo y dedicarle a sus hijos. Asimismo afirma que esta actividad ha hecho que toda su familia trabaje en equipo y por ello se siente satisfecha. Por ahora su mayor meta es tener su propio terreno para instalar su propia fábrica y producir ladrillos en mayores cantidades. Es su décimo crédito con MFP, esta muy contenta de  saber que tiene un apoyo financiero ya que siempre ha demostrado  ser responsable en sus pagos, además  le agrada ser parte de su banco comunal porque  todos sus integrantes son personas responsables y muy solidarias, agradece  a aquellas personas que serán gestoras del préstamo que solicita y le será  muy útil en el progreso de su negocio. Con el crédito que solicita, lo invertirá para comprar varios metros de plástico que le servirán para tapar los ladrillos en tiempos de lluvia, así mismo comprará insumos para empezar con la fabricación de este material. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Elena is 31 years old. She lives with her husband and two children in their own house. For 11 years, she has worked in brick making.  At first, she was working in a brick factory. After some time, she noticed that it was more convenient to buy brick directly and she became a distributor of the material in the area where she lives. She takes advantage of the fact that her husband also works in this field of business and has many contacts. With his resources, they are able to distribute their time. Elena only works half the day in order to have time to spend with her children. This way, her family works as a team and for this reason she feels satisfied. For now, her main goal is to have her own plot of land to put her own factory and to produce bricks in larger quantities. This is her tenth loan with MFP. She is very pleased to know she has financial support since she has always been responsible with her payments. In addition, she likes being a part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive of each other. She is grateful for the people who will fund this loan which will be very helpful for her business’ progress.  With this loan, she will invest it in meters of plastic that will cover the bricks during periods of rain. She will also purchase consumables in order to start producing the bricks. </en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>375</funded_amount><paid_amount>375</paid_amount><image><id>701233</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Manufacturing</activity><sector>Manufacturing</sector><use>to buy materials for the production of bricks and meters of plastic</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>HUANCAYO</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-12.066667 -75.233333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-28T20:50:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>375</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Elena </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-12-27T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>375</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>167</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-04T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>167</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>167</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>167</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>167</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-07-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>165</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.63</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.62</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.63</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.62</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.63</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>61.87</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>62.63</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2011-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-03-24T08:51:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>173.53</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>195887264</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.62</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-15T11:37:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>173.54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201327628</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.63</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T11:33:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>173.53</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206196163</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.62</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2011-05-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-06-15T11:42:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>173.53</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>211269840</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.63</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T11:32:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>173.54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216549858</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>61.87</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2011-07-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-08-15T09:12:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>171.45</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>221718517</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-28T21:27:14Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-08-15T09:12:45Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>268667</id><name>Carolina Enriqueta</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Carolina, tiene 26 años de edad y vive en la ciudad del Cusco, Perú.

She has been crafting beautiful embroidery for the past 2 years. She started out when a friend taught her everything there is to know about this art form. Today she works independently and from the comfort of her home. She can take care of the chores and look after her kids. In addition to this she also cultivates alfalfa to later sell in wholesale. She doesn&apos;t have a fixed work scheduler but she is very dedicated to her embroidery. With the detail of the work involved and the richness of the embroidery takes up to a month to complete one piece. But the final product is a beautiful traditional piece of clothing that is the subject of admiration from her clients who ultimately decide to make the buy, in cash. The most profit is earned during the traditional season of festivities, named the Feast of Santiago. It is a time for celebration in her region. She wants to increase the embroidered skirts and to hire help to assist her in production. It is her fourth loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she is very happy to know she has this source of financial support. She has always demonstrated to be responsible with her payments and she is very glad to be a member of her community bank. All of the other members of the communal bank are responsible and make a very strong group. She is thankful to those individuals who are contributors to the loan she requests.

The members decided to give the group this name because it is the name of the neighborhood where they all live. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This story is about Silvia C. V. since she is the group&apos;s president.  Silvia is 37 years old, married, and has four children: Arturo, Areli, KarL. and Alejandro.  All four are in school.  The first two are in the sixth and fifth year of elementary school, the third is in the third year of pre-school and the youngest is barely a year old.  Silvia owns a fruit store.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Silvia decided to start out in this business because a family member told her that it was a very good source of income.  She also knew that it would help her to support her husband with their household expenses and their children&apos;s education expenses and would improve their family&apos;s quality of life.  Silvia invested her loan in buying merchandise such as: apples, bananas, oranges, tomatoes, chili peppers, onions, potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, lettuce and other fruit and veg.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Silvia is very happy because she says that her business is doing very well.  Both her sales and her number of customers have increased quite a bit.  This means that her profits have also risen satisfactorily, so much so, in fact, that she has even been able to buy an iron.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Silvia&apos;s goal is to continue supporting her children in their studies so that they can finish complete their higher education and have a better future.  She would also like to grow her small business some more since she would like to expand the premises where she has her fruit store a little.  This will mean that she can better stock her store and thereby sell a wider range of produce and improve her profits.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Silvia tells us that her group works very well since all the members have known each other for some time and they are very responsible in making their repayments since they don&apos;t want to let people down after they have placed their trust in them and supported them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Silvia is very grateful to Fundación Realidad and Kiva lenders for the unconditional support that they are providing since it has meant that her quality of life and that of her family has improved and she has been able to continue investing in her business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The names and business activities of the rest of the Huamuchapa group members follow below:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Celia C.

The group is maD. up of 10 members.  Florentina L. is 50 years old, and studied in primary school.  She is a craftswoman, and has two children: a daughter and a son.  Her business is handicrafts, in plaster figurines, which she started 10 years ago.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She is requesting the loan in order to buy stones, since that is how the plaster comes, in a form in which she has to chip away first, and then grind.  She wants to fulfill her customers requests.  Some neighbors and customers of hers comment that she makes very beautiful figurines, both seasonal figurines as well as figurines that her customers request.  She makes figurines from 10 cm to 3 meters tall, and what she sells most are angels.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Florentina sells her figurines in the community, and in neighboring communities, as well as in street markets and fairs.  At the time of requesting the loan, she is very happy.  She wants this loan in order to buy the necessary supplies such as paints, varnishes, hardeners and stones in order to fulfill her orders.  Also, she hopes with her earnings to be able to buy a polisher in order to save time and get out her orders quickly since up until now, she has been doing it by hand.  Her greatest wish is to give her children a dignified life and education, and to continue being a better example of the fight to get ahead.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>3450</funded_amount><paid_amount>3450</paid_amount><image><id>701271</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Crafts</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>paints,

She considers herself to be a very hardworking and multifaceted person, as she has been working in all types of businesses for the past four years depending on the season.  She now works selling gelatin by foot, while her husband has a business distributing peeled and diced potatoes to restaurants.  However, in order to have more income, she set up a guinea pig farm six months ago, where she raises them and sells them when they reach the right weight.  The meat merchants in the area are her main buyers.  She considers this business to be very profitable and thanks to it, she is getting the financial stability that her family needs.  In addition, it allows her to set her own hours.  This is why she wants to continue working with this business to grow financially.  This is her fourth loan with MFP and she is very happy to know that she has financial support, as she has always proven to be responsible with her payments.

Since he raised his price per kilo, he has earned a good income, which motivates him to continue working in this area.  He invests the money he earns in his university studies.

With the new profits from her expanded business, Grace plans to re-invest back into the food preparation business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>701302</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase more sacks of maize and other ingredients, which she will store and use in bits so that the constant increase in prices for goods won&apos;t affect her so much. </use><location><country_code>GH</country_code><country>Ghana</country><town>Elmina</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>5.083333 -1.35</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>91</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-27T14:40:14Z</posted_date><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Grace Acquah </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2011-01-11T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>GHS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>425</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-11T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>106.25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-11T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>106.25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>106.25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>106.25</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>106.25</local_amount><processed_date>2011-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-22T08:01:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>114.3</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>195818618</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>106.25</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-25T07:57:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>114.3</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201893835</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>106.25</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-06-16T08:03:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>114.3</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206128009</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>106.25</local_amount><processed_date>2011-05-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-06-23T07:49:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>114.3</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>211199838</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-27T16:45:34Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-06-23T07:49:31Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>268709</id><name>Aba</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Aba A.  is married and has five dependents.

and blessed). The 15 members are all Haitian citizens or descendants from Haitians who emigrated from Haiti. Her story is representative of both her group and Esperanza&apos;s Haitian and Dominican clients in general. Her group is located in the rural area of El Seybo, surrounded by sugar cane fields, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and they have two adult children.&#10;&#10;Lolita is excited to be seeking her seventh loan with Esperanza, being part of Esperanza Microfinance program in El Seybo since 2007.  She plans to use this loan to invest in her business. She operates a breakfast sales business from her home. She sells breakfast like bread, cafe, tea, sausages, plantains, etc. She will use the profits to continue improving her business while saving part of it to visit or send to her family in Haiti, when they have any needs. Her most difficult challenge is to come back to Haiti and live a safe and comfortable life. &#10;&#10;The photos were taken separately, one with five members and the other one with ten, just to have more focus on the faces. Lolita thanks all of you for your support.

It is a very agricultural area.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Mr. Hernan works building houses and his wife is in charge of their dairy cows. Both activities generate income that has helped them to sustain their family up to this point. They only have three dairy cows, which produce 15 liters of milk each day.

He rents a mixing machine, which has been very costly, and therefore he hasn&apos;t been able to save much. He realized it is necessary to request a loan so he can obtain his own mixing machine. This way, he will able to be save money for his family over time.

José Herbin is 12 years old and Diana Laura is 9 years old.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Blanca Aracely will invest her loan money in buying and selling Andrea-brand shoes.  She will also buy Avon-brand cosmetics which she started selling four years ago.  Her business has done very well since it has made her good profits.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Blanca Aracely started out in this line of business since a loan requires you to work and the best way to work is to invest the loan in a business that makes good profits.  In this way she has managed to get her family ahead in life.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With every sale that she makes, she saves so that when she has to go and make more orders, she has a source of merchandise.  This allows her to be punctual in making her repayments.  Her dream is to some day manage to own her own shoe store so that she can support her two children until they finish their university studies which will allow them to support themselves in life.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>700596</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe

Maruja is currently saving up to build a house. &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>701430</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Buying goods on a wholesale basis</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Ayacucho</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-13.158333 -74.223889</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>70</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-30T01:30:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maruja </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2011-01-25T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>2000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-20T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-17T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-07-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120.84</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120.84</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>120.83</amount><local_amount>333.33</local_amount><processed_date>2011-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-03-15T11:38:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334.82</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>195839431</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>120.83</amount><local_amount>333.33</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-15T10:59:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334.83</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201281942</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>120.84</amount><local_amount>333.33</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T10:56:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334.82</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206149911</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>120.83</amount><local_amount>333.33</local_amount><processed_date>2011-05-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-06-15T11:10:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334.83</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>211222987</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>120.83</amount><local_amount>333.33</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T11:02:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334.82</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216501910</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>120.84</amount><local_amount>333.35</local_amount><processed_date>2011-07-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-08-15T08:44:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334.85</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>221665821</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-30T05:53:21Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-08-15T08:44:31Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>268745</id><name>Primavera 2011 Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es> “Primavera 2011”, es un grupo ubicado en la comunidad de San Lorenzo del estado Oaxaca, esta población esta habitada por indígenas mixtecos de la zona de la costa, al grupo lo integra un numero de 12 mujeres indígenas y nativas de este poblado, nombrando por líder a la señora Cresenciana B. M..&#10;El nombre que le atribuyeron a su grupo es por una característica propia del lugar, debido a la vegetación y la diversidad de árboles, plantas, aves y animales muy propios de la zona, antes de arribar a la población podemos observar un hermoso río que desde las alturas muestra su majestuosa limpieza en sus corrientes, ofreciendo siempre un paisaje que deja marcadas nuestras pupilas, el esta comunidad la mayoría de la gente se dedica al trabajo en el campo y en el caso de las mujeres se enfocan a la elaboración de artesanías de telar de cintura, una actividad que data de tiempos muy remotos y hasta la actualidad, las tradiciones del pueblo indígena aun la podemos vivir en carne propia con sus majestuosos atuendos y ceremonias que deja mucho de que hablar, captando la atención de toda la gente que la visita.&#10;En esta historia hablaremos de una integrante llamada Ninfa García M. de 40 años de edad, ella esta casada con Eleuterio de 42 años quien es campesino de toda la vida, tiene 3 hijos que son: José Luis de 15 años estudiante de 3ro de secundaria, Raúl de 13 años estudia el 1ro de secundaria y Elizabeth de 10 años estudiante de 5to año de primaria.&#10;Ninfa se dedica a la elaboración de artesanías, ella elabora servilletas, manteles y telar de cintura, la elaboración de estas bellas prendas la aprendió desde los 13 años de edad, cabe mencionar que las niñas de esta comunidad deben de aprender a fabricar este tipo de arte al igual que los quehaceres de la casa como el hacer tortillas, cocinar y cuidar a los niños, para Ninfa esta actividad ha sido la mejo alternativa para apoyar a su esposo e hijos en los gastos necesarios de la casa, al igual que ella la mayoría de las mujeres han optado por dedicarse a este oficio mismo que les ha permitido el aseguramiento de recursos para preservar la educación de sus hijos al igual que permite la conservación de este arte tradicional con las generaciones venideras. &#10;Ninfa se integro a este grupo de crédito con la finalidad  de obtener un financiamiento para invertir en su actividad, ella con esta dinero va comprar hilo de algodón blanco utilizado para la base de la producción de estos textiles, hilo vela de algodón en diferentes colores, madejas para hilar, estambres para el acabado de las servilletas y manteles, con esta adquisición de material ella garantiza mas producción y mas ventas en su actividad, con las ganancias ella le dará educación a sus hijos, liquidara su crédito y seguirá elaborando estas artesanías.&#10;A Ninfa le gustaría distribuir sus productos en otros lugares diferentes del estado de Oaxaca, ella aspira a mejorar sui calidad de vida, mejorar su vivienda y que sus hijos tengan un futuro mejor y sin carencias.&#10;Deposita sus esperanzas en sus tres hijos que cuando ellos sean personas de bien la puedan ayudar a ella y a su esposo, desea con todo su corazón que sus hijos se preparen profesionalmente para que no tengan que vivir en la pobreza. No olvidemos que la mayoría de las poblaciones indígenas no tienen acceso a los servicios básicos de desarrollo, es un sector abandonado por la sociedad y el trabajo en el campo no garantiza una vida cómoda.&#10;Ninfa invita a las personas que se encuentran alrededor del mundo a sumarse a esta causa justa por los que menos tienen, a kiva le da las gracias por abrirle las puertas de la esperanza, a Fundacion Realidad, por su muestra de compromiso con el sector abandonado y por la confianza que les brinda a las mujeres indígenas.&#10;&#10;&#10; “Primavera” esta integrado por 12 mujeres mujeres indígenas y   enseguida se dan los nombres de cada una de ellas, así como las actividades que realizan para la obtención de recursos.&#10;&#10;Demetria B.

The town is inhabited by Mixtec indians from the coastal area.  The group is made up of 12 native indians from this town and Mrs. Cresenciana B. M. is their leader.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The name given to the group is due to the characteristics of the diversity of the vegetation, trees, plants, birds and animals that are autoctonus to the area.  Before we reach the town we can see a beautiful river that flows majectically in a clean stream.  The landscape always catches our attention.  The people here work mainly in agriculture.  Women usually focus on weaving belts which is a craft that comes from long ago.  The traditions of the local indian folk are still very much alive and we are able to witness first hand the majestic attire and ceremonies that capture the attention of everyone visiting the area. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In this narrative we will talk about a member named Ninfa García Mejía who is 40 years old, married to Eleuterio who is 42 years old and has been a field worker all his life.  They have three children: José Luis who is 15 and in his third year of secondary school, Raúl who is 13 and in his first year of secondary school and Elizabeth who is 10 years old and in 5th grade.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ninfa has been making artisan crafts, napkins, tablecloths, and waistbands since she was 13 years old.  The girls in the community always learn this type of art just as they learn how to make tortillas, cook and take care of children.  For Ninfa this activity has been the best alternative she&apos;s had to help her husband and children with household expenses.  Just like her, most women do this to provide an education for their children and also maintain the traditional artform that has been handed down for generations. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ninfa joined this group to get financing for her business.  She plans to use the loan to buy while cotton thread, which she uses as the basis for her textile products, different colored cotton yarn, and spun woolen thread to finish the tablecloths and napkins.  With this purchase she will be able to guarantee production and more sales.  She will use the income to cover education costs for her children, pay back the loan and continue making her crafts.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ninfa would like to sell her products in other locations in the state of Oaxaca.  She wants to improve her lifestyle and her home so her children will have better prospects in the future.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She places her hopes on her three children so that when they grow into responsible people they will help her and her husband.  She wants her children to be professionals so they won&apos;t have to live in poverty.  We musn&apos;t forget that the indigenous populations do not have access to basic services for development.  It is a sector of society that has been abandoned.  Working the fields does not guarantee a comfortable lifestyle.  Ninfa invites people around the world to join the just cause for those who have less.  She thanks Kiva for opening the door to hope and the Fundación Realidad for showing its committment to this abandoned sector, also for the confidence shown in their indigenous women.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&quot;Primavera&quot; is made up of 12 indigenous women.

She lives in her parents&apos; house. She has been part of the communal bank since its initiation, six loan cycles ago, and she likes it because of the favorable terms offered by the Espoir Foundation for obtaining loans. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her work is selling clothing of all types as well as household articles such as blenders, toasters and irons, among other items. She sells her merchandise door to door as well as from her home, where she has a small shop. She works Monday through Saturday, since she dedicates Sunday to her young son. She provides goods on credit to her customers and collects payments every two weeks. She buys the clothing she sells in Guayaquil and the household goods in Picoaza, every two weeks or once a month, according to her needs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This loan is to buy pants, blouses, irons and blenders, among other goods.

Durante todo este tiempo, pudo ahorrar suficiente capital, así pudo lograr comprar una fotocopiadora y ahora realiza este servicio de fotocopiado de documentos. Se siente muy satisfecha con el negocio que tiene ya que obtiene regulares ganancias de las ventas. Hoy ha invertido en otra librería, en donde un empleado que contrato lo esta ayudando en la atención de los clientes. Manifiesta que no puede salir mucho por no descuidar ambos negocios, y como es una mujer trabajadora tiene planeado mejorar las instalaciones de ambos negocios para ofrecer un mejor servicio a sus clientes. Es el segundo crédito que tiene con MFP y promete pagar sus cuotas puntualmente, pues no quiere quedar mal con las personas que hicieron posible el dinero que le permitirá continuar trabajando en busca del progreso. Lidia tiene planeado invertir el crédito solicitado en la compra de cuadernos, papelería en general además de útiles escolares que necesita para surtir mejor ambos negocios, y ofrecer variedad a sus compradores.&#10;&#10;</es><en>Lidia, 32, lives in a house she owns along with her husband German, also 32 and a teacher, and her small daughter.

Her youngest daughter lives with her. A while ago she worked as a public worker but she left the field and began working in sales.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Dolores works selling all types of clothing, she does her sales door to door and in her home where her customers go when there is new merchandize. Her daughter also helps her maintain the business. Mrs. Dolores works everyday in the evenings; she sells on credit to her customers and collects every two weeks. Mrs. Dolores buys her merchandize in Guayaquil every fifteen days.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This loan is to buy more clothing, mostly women’s, as well as pants, blouses, shirts, and other items.

juntos se esfuerzan cada día por salir adelante. Esta emprendedora mujer se dedica a la venta de comestibles y útiles de escritorio en una tienda que habilitó en una pieza de su casa. Esta muy satisfecha pues sus vecinos prefieren comprarle pues su trato es muy amable y ofrece sus productos  a buenos precios, además las ganancias que obtiene son buenas y puede apoyar a su pareja en los gastos del hogar. Lo que no le gusta es que debe permanecer bastante tiempo en su casa para no descuidar el negocio, aunque hay veces que sus familiares la apoyan en la atención hacia los clientes. Para el futuro tiene planeado mejorar las instalaciones de su local, pues quiere ofrecer un mejor servicio a sus compradores. Es el séptimo crédito que tiene con MFP y promete pagar sus cuotas puntualmente, pues no quiere quedar mal con las personas que hicieron posible este aporte que le permitirá continuar trabajando en busca del progreso. Alicia tiene planeado invertir el crédito solicitado en la compra de cantidad de mercadería en productos comestibles, así como útiles pues esta cercana la campaña escolar y quiere cumplir con la mayoría de los pedidos de sus clientes. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Alicia is 54 years old; she lives in her own home with her partner, Osvaldo, who is 55 years old and their two young children. Each day they work hard to get ahead in life. This enterprising woman works selling foodstuffs and office supplies in a store that she made out a room in her home. Alicia is very happy since her neighbors prefer to buy from her since she treats her customers with kindness and she offers her products at good prices. What she does not like is that she has to spend a lot of time at home so as to not neglect her business although sometimes her family helps her take care of the customers. For the future she wants to improve her store as she wants to give better service to her customers. This is her seventh loan with MFP (Kiva’s field partner) Alicia promises to pay her loan quotas on time since she doesn’t want to deceive the people who have made possible this loan that will allow her to continue working toward her progress. Alicia has planned to use the loan to buy various grocery products as well as office supplies since school time is approaching and she wants to meet the majority of her customers’ needs.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>375</funded_amount><paid_amount>375</paid_amount><image><id>701446</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Lleva casi 4 años dedicada a la venta de golosinas, gaseosas y productos de primera necesidad en una pieza habilitada de su casa. Empieza su labor a las 7 de la mañana y puede quedarse atendiendo hasta las 9 de la noche, pues dice que mayores son las ganancias mientras más tiempo tenga abierto el negocio; algunas veces cuenta con el apoyo en la atención de sus hijos o de su pareja cuando ella debe salir. Esta muy satisfecha con el negocio pues le permite realizar sus labores del hogar sin problemas, además de ayudar a su esposo en los gastos del hogar. Como es una dama muy emprendedora para el futuro tiene planeado instalar una librería en una parte de su tienda, pues no hay ninguna por la zona donde vive y calcula que tendría mucho éxito. Es el séptimo crédito que tiene con MFP y promete pagar sus cuotas puntualmente, pues no quiere quedar mal con las personas que hicieron posible el dinero que le permitirá continuar adelante con su negocio. Marcelina tiene planeado invertir el crédito solicitado en la compra de alimentos que necesita para surtir bien su negocio, pues quiere ofrecer lo mejor a sus clientes. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Marcelina is 60 years old she lives in her own home with her husband, José who is 64 years old and their 3 young children. They work hard each day to get ahead. For almost 4 years, Marcelina has sold candy, beverages and basic household goods in a room in her home. She begins working from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. and says that most of her earnings are due to how long the business is open. Sometimes she has help from her children or her partner when she has to go out. Marcelina is very happy with the business since it allows her to do housework without problems and it helps her husband meet the household expenses. Since she is a very enterprising woman concerned about the future, she plans to have a bookshop in her store since there isn’t one in the area where she lives and believes that it will be successful. This is her seventh loan with MFP (Kiva’s field partner) and is committed to meet the payments on time since she doesn’t want to deceive the people who helped her get the money that will allow her to continue successfully with her business. Marcelina plans to use the loan to buy foodstuffs that she needs to stock her business since she wants to offer the best to her customers.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>375</funded_amount><paid_amount>375</paid_amount><image><id>701451</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Together they strive everyday to come out ahead. Since a young age Jorge has worked hard in the construction business. He started out as a laborer and he now works as a construction manager for a company from Monday through Saturday, all day. He says that he likes his work because his company sends him to different parts of Perú, and he feels satisfied when he finishes a big project working alongside his colleagues. This job also generates a regular income which allows him to offer his family a good quality of life. He has many plans for the future, such as installing a general store in his house that his wife and daughters would run. This is his first loan with MFP and he promises to make his payments on time because he doesn&apos;t want to upset the people who make it possible for him to keep progressing. Jorge plans to invest the loan in the purchase of construction materials (cement, bricks, sand, and metal) that he needs to finish expanding his home. With these renovations he hopes to keep moving ahead.

He and his wife, Mrs. San Em, are farmers who own a 1.5-hectare plot of land where they grow rice and vegetables to sell. Their field has some problems because the soil is not very fertile.

In the past 12 years, she has managed to increase her money 12 times over. Her business has expanded even a little more now so she is able to buy a certain amount of meat and sell it in her stall in the local market. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Even though she has a hearing impairment, she has been trying hard to operate a successful business and has managed so far. She is a good-tempered, hard-working woman. Alimaa says, &quot;My dream is to help my son to build up a source of regular income so that he can live without stress all his life.&quot; She is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to buy and keep

Quirino, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 46 years old. Corazon is married and has 4 children. To make a living, Corazon operates a family member&apos;s business venture in the retail sector, running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap &amp; toothpaste in the local community. Corazon has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Corazon joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Corazon has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Corazon is requesting a new loan of 23,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Corazon from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>525</funded_amount><paid_amount>525</paid_amount><image><id>700327</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to purchase new items to expand product offering</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>Brgy.

She lives in Bugho, Bagalnga, Compostela, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;By working hard in her &apos;abaca&apos; weaving and hog-raising businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,100. Flora is now borrowing PHP 13,500 so that she can buy frames and stocks for &apos;abaca&apos;.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Flora aspires to elevate her family&apos;s living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work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en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>325</funded_amount><paid_amount>325</paid_amount><image><id>701540</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Weaving</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Additional

and a ready-to-wear clothes business.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She lives in Tak-an, Danao City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;By working hard in her food stall, general store and ready-to-wear clothes businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Anecia is now borrowing PHP 18,000 so that she can buy rice and spices for her eatery and stocks for the general store. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Anecia aspires to elevate her family&apos;s living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: &#13;&#10;In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means &quot;honorable&quot;). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

ventures: hog raising, general store and livestock. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her husband, Emmanuel, who is 51 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife&apos;s business activities. They have one child who is 17 years old and is currently going to school.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lucilita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucilita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This time, for her eighth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy feed, medicines and vaccines for her pigs and stocks for the general store so that she can continue to save up for her child&apos;s education and for future home repairs. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lucilita Z. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: &#13;&#10;In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means &quot;honorable&quot;). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

sobrino quien los ha dejado a cargo; ella es una señora mayor pero con un espíritu de superación, por lo cual decidió montar un negocio de comida que esta ubicado en las cercanías de la Universidad de El Salvador, adonde es ayudada por su compañero de vida elaborando alimentos para desayunos y almuerzos que son comercializados entre los alumnos de dicha universidad.Este es un trabajo pesado pero es la única fuente de ingreso para su hogar y es la forma en la que ellos mantienen todas sus necesidades; el préstamo solicitado es  para la compra de más materia prima como arroz, frijoles, maíz y algunos vegetales; además de bebidas y golosinas, también se espera hacer un  mejoramiento de su pequeño negocio que esta hecho de láminas y así poder hacerlo crecer al igual que sus ingresos. &#10;</es><en>Rosa Lidia A. is 68 years old and she lives with her husband in San Salvador. They live in a house belonging to a nephew. She is an older person but she has the will to improve, which is why she has decided to set up a food stall near the university in El Salvador. She gets help by her life partner to make the breakfast and lunch foods that are sold to the students at the university. It is hard work but it is the only source of income for their household and it is the way they are able to provide for all of their needs. This loan will be used to purchase ingredients such as rice, beans, corn, some vegetables, soft drinks, and snacks. They will also carry out some improvements to their small stand. It is made of aluminum sheeting and they want to expand the stall as their earnings grow.

She is 46 years old. Elizabeth is married and has five children. Her eldest child is 21 years old while the youngest is only 6. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To make a living, Elizabeth plants and harvests rice for sale. Elizabeth wishes for her children to finish college and have bright futures.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Elizabeth is requesting a loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase seeds and fertilizers. This will be the first loan taken out by Elizabeth from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to their house. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About CEVI:&#13;&#10;Community Economic Ventures, Inc. (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over recent years. Based in Bohol, it has numerous branches throughout the Philippines. In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring. CEVI not only provides its clients credit, but also savings, insurance and training, which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>100</funded_amount><paid_amount>100</paid_amount><image><id>701663</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To purchase seeds and fertilizers</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>San Francisco, Agusan Del Sur</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>13 122</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>125</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-27T16:30:07Z</posted_date><loan_amount>100</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Elizabeth</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2011-01-24T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PHP</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>4000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>100</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>4000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>4000</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T10:46:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>4446.78</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216479950</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-27T19:14:30Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-07-15T10:46:34Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>268844</id><name>Moses</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Moses is a single man who owns a house that has neither electricity nor piped water.

She is 50 years old. Guibay is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Guibay owns &amp; operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Guibay has been engaged in farming for 6 years now. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Guibay joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Guibay is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds and fertilizers. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Guibay from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay for her children&apos;s tuition fees. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About CEVI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Community Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.  Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring.  CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>May F. is from the village of Disimuray, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 36 years old. May is the group leader of an eight-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;May is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, May raises pigs for fattening and sale. May is just starting this business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, May joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. May has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;May is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the second loan taken out by May from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About ASKI:&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1600</funded_amount><paid_amount>1600</paid_amount><image><id>701618</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Maricar, 20 years old, is from the town of San Francisco. She is married and has a 2-year-old child. To make a living, Maricar owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. At her young age, Maricar is already a responsible mother to her child. She starts to save little by little for her child&apos;s future.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Maricar joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maricar is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers and seeds. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Maricar from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family&apos;s living conditions. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About CEVI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Community Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.  Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines. In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring. CEVI not only provides credit for its clients, but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>100</funded_amount><paid_amount>100</paid_amount><image><id>701682</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To purchase fertilizers and seeds</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>San Francisco, Agusan Del Sur</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>13 122</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>125</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-27T16:20:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>100</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maricar</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2011-01-24T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PHP</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>4000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>100</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>4000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>4000</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T10:46:29Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>4446.78</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216479955</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-27T17:57:17Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-07-15T10:46:29Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>268855</id><name>Gorret</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Gorret is a 35-year-old single woman living in her own permanent house in Fort Portal, Uganda.

His business is located in the heart of Kisumu Municipal Fish Market, where there are many people, and therefore, many customers. Erick has been in business for four years now. His business is profitable, but he has major financial constraints. He works very hard to keep his business doing well. He plans to use his loan of 40,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) to buy a motor bike.  He should then be able to do more business for a longer time, since a motor bike is more durable than a bicycle.  He sees himself diversifying into other types of businesses and improving his standard of living.

She is married and has 6 children. Her eldest child is 15 years old, while the youngest is only 3. To make a living, Myrna owns &amp; operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Myrna works hard to sustain her children&apos;s education. She says that as their mother, it&apos;s her responsibility to give them proper education.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Myrna joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase seeds and fertilizers. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Myrna from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About CEVI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Community Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

O. is a married man. His wife is a business lady, and they have no children yet. He owns a bicycle which he uses to provide transport services. His target market is comprised of fish mongers in the area, ice bar suppliers and other local walk-in customers. He is located in the heart of Kisumu Municipal Fish Market, where there are many people and thus, many customers. Joseph has been in business for five years now. His business is profitable.  His major challenges are financial constraints and congestion at the bus terminal, which hinders free and easy movement. He works very hard to keep his business doing well. He plans to use his loan of 40,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) to buy a motor bike. That will allow him to do more business for a longer time, since it is more durable than a bicycle.  He sees himself purchasing a rickshaw to grow his business and improve his standard of living. He describes himself as humble, strong and

Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines. In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring.

She is single and has 4 children, all of whom are in school. Eseri has a business of selling charcoal and bunches of bananas. She has been in this business for 4 years, and she works 7 days out of every week. Eseri sells her products at the market, by means of retail.    &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Eseri has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy more bags of charcoal and bunches of bananas. The main business challenge(s) for Eseri include transportation and the ever increasing prices of bananas and charcoal. Her goals and aspirations for her business are to buy a plot and to build rental rooms and also to start selling by wholesale only. Eseri lives in a home that she owns; she has access to electricity, but doesn&apos;t have access to piped water. Her major monthly expenses include food, school fees and medication.

O. is a married man. His wife is a business-lady and they have seven children aged between twenty-nine years old and fifteen years old. He owns a bicycle which he uses to provide transport services. His target market is comprised of fishmongers in the area, ice bar suppliers and other local walk-in customers. He is located at the heart of Kisumu Municipal Fish Market where there are many people thus many customers to serve. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;George has been in business for seven years now. His business is profitable, but his major challenge is financial constraints. He also says that during the rainy season business is usually low because many people prefer closed vehicles since they are sheltered from cold and rain. He works very hard to keep his business doing well. He plans to use his loan of 40,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) to buy a motorbike which will do more business for a longer time since it is more durable than a bicycle.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He sees himself growing his business and imparting business skills to young people so that they can be able to better their lives. He describes himself as humble, motivated and kind.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>498.81</paid_amount><image><id>701703</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Motorcycle

Tous étudient dont 3 viennent de finir leurs premiers cycles de graduat à l’université. Son conjoint est un pasteur, serviteur de Dieu dans une église évangélique de la place.  La cliente Nyirahabimana M.  est entrepreneur d’un cafeteria-resto installé  sur  la route principale Goma-Sake-Masisi.  Elle fait également le petit commerce de vente des souliers. Vers 2003, elle commença son business  avec son fonds propre reçu de son mari. Plus tard, elle bénéficia de crédit de l’IMF  Hekima de 50$ au début de  2009. Ce nouveau crédit doit lui servir de s’approvisionner  avec  des nouveaux produits alimentaires (2 casiers de Fanta, 50 kg de haricots, 20 litres de lait caillé, 10 kg des pommes de terre, 5 kg de viandes, 1 bidon d’huile, sel de cuisine, etc.) et une moitié sera affectée dans le commerce de souliers.  En plus, elle ambitionne devenir commerçante grossiste des souliers. Etant donne que ce dernier offre plus des bénéfices que la cafétéria. La cliente Nyirahabimana M.  remercie Hekima de ses actions pour la promotion des pauvres femmes exclues de banque classique. Le groupe Atuwezeshe est constitué de 17 membres mais sur la photo il ya l’excédent de leur collègue dans les affaires.

All of the children are studying and three of them have finished their first graduate cycle at university. Her husband is a pastor and a servant of God in the evangelical church on the square. This customer, Nyirahabimana M., is an entrepreneur with a cafeteria/restaurant on the Goma-Sake-Masisi main road. She also has a small business selling shoes. She began her business around 2003 with her own funds which she got from her husband. Later on, at the beginning of 2009, she benefited from a loan of USD50 from IMF Helima. This new loan will allow her to stock up on new food products (two crates of Fanta, 50kg of beans, 20 litres of curd cheese, 10kg of potatoes, 5kg of meat, one container of oil, kitchen salt, etc.); half of the loan will be allotted to her shoe business. Furthermore, she has an ambition to become a wholesaler trader of shoes, given that this activity generates more profits than the cafeteria. Mrs M. is grateful to Hekima for its actions in helping poor women who are rejected by classic banks. The Atuwezeshe group is made up of 17 members although there are 18 people in the photo.

O. is twenty-four years old. He is single and does not have any children yet. He owns a motor rickshaw which he uses to provide transport to local people. His target market is comprised of local shoppers at the United Shopping Mall in Kisumu. His business is located near the shopping mall where there are many people thus many customers to serve. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;William has been in business for two years now. His business is profitable, but his major challenge is parking space for motor rickshaw owners who are intimidated by vehicle owners. He works very hard to keep his business doing well.

Her husband, Mr. Sok Sorn, is a construction worker and a fisherman.

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Nida G. is from the village of Villa Luna, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 48 years old. Nida is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nida is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Nida owns &amp; operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food &amp; daily use products in the local community. Nida has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2009, Nida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Nida is requesting a new loan of 18,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Nida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1750</funded_amount><paid_amount>1750</paid_amount><image><id>701748</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

He is married and has four children; Lufrit, who is 16 years old, in the second grade of Senior high school, Once, who is 14 years old, in the second grade of Junior high school, Veni, who is 10 years old, in the fifth grade of Elementary school and Angga, who is 2 and a half years old.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Yoksan used to work in a local shop in Kupang. As a shop worker, his salary was very small. Working for years in the shop didn’t bring any improvement in his family&apos;s living standards. The increasing market prices from year to year often distressed him. He really needed some extra income and he couldn’t just rely on his work. After a discussion with his wife, he decided to leave his job. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Using his own capital, Yoksan started a new business as a fishmonger in Inpres market – a local market in Kupang. He purchases fish from the fisherman in Tablolong, about one hour&apos;s drive from Kupang City. Due to the lack of capital, Yoksan cannot increase his business stock to enable him to generate more income. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Yoksan really wants to improve his business by adding more fish to sell. He is requesting his first individual loan from TLM amounting to IDR 5,000,000. He hopes that TLM is willing to support him by providing the loan.</en></texts></description><status>in_repayment</status><funded_amount>575</funded_amount><paid_amount>342.7</paid_amount><image><id>701774</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fish

She lives with her husband, Dominggus, and their son, Feto, who is 8 years old and in the third grade of elementary school. People usually call Esly “Uki” as her nickname. She has a kiosk business while her husband is a tailor.  They run the businesses at their house. Elsy and her husband are hard workers; they always work together to meet their family&apos;s needs.&#13;&#10;  &#13;&#10;Esly usually operates her kiosk from 6 a.m. until 9 p.m. She sells variety of snack items, noodles, sugar, cigarettes, detergent, biscuits, soap and many other household needs. She started her kiosk business by using her own money as business capital.  Her money just enabled her to buy a variety of small items. She was only able to generate a meager income from her kiosk. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Esly joined TLM’s small group lending program for two loan cycles. All loan money was used to add more items to her kiosk. She can generate a better income from the improved business stock. However, she still wants to expand her kiosk by selling basic household needs such as rice, kerosene and gasoline that are not available at her kiosk at the moment. For that reason, she is requesting an individual loan amounting to IDR 3,000,000 from TLM. She definitely believes that loan will help her to improve her business.

N. is 29 years old and is married to Elyakim, 33 years old. They have been blessed with four children: Jack, who is nine years old; Aldy, who is seven; Ray, who is five; and Resky, who is three. Three of the children are in school. Thidora and her family live in Taklale village. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;To support her husband in meeting their family’s needs, Thidora runs a small kiosk. Her husband provided her with a small amount of money to buy noodles, sugar, coffee, a variety of snacks, cigarettes, detergent, soap, etc. Besides working at home, she loves running her business, as it generates income for her family. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Thidora sees that she could earn more if she could stock her kiosk with a greater variety of goods. Taklale village is situated in a remote area, around thirty kilometers from Kupang City, and most of the community members in the village are farmers. Thidora is requesting a loan amounting to 10,000,000 IDR in order to stock her kiosk with a larger variety of basic household needs such as rice, kerosene, frying oil, etc. She hopes TLM might be able to help her in realizing her plan.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>in_repayment</status><funded_amount>1125</funded_amount><paid_amount>427.5</paid_amount><image><id>701763</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

They live in a small house with a &apos;ger&apos;, a Mongolian nomadic housing tent, next to it on the outskirts of the city. They had to build the &apos;ger&apos; as they are a big family and the house that they own is too small for 8 people. Two of  Nyambayar&apos;s children go to university while three others attend secondary school. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nyambayar started his clothes retail trading business in 1991 with a working capital of 500,000 MNT by renting an outdoor stall at a local market in Darhan.  In ten years&apos; time, he has managed to enlarge his  business by operating lingerie sales and has increased his working capital 3 times over. He wants to rent an extra stall and expand his business by operating a clothing trading business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nyambayar is a gentle and hard-working person who says, &quot;My desperate wish is to be able to provide my children with the opportunity to get a good education so that in the future they can have a good life. And I would also like to expand my business.&quot; He is requesting a loan of 1,800,000 MNT to bring in more goods for sale due to Tsagaan Sar, Mongolian Traditional New Year, as everyone buys gifts for each other.

Dikson lives with his wife and two children in a modest house. The children are Jeanet, aged 17 years, and Richard, who is 15. Both attend school. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Besides running the motor-taxi business, Dikson also runs a billiard business. He realizes that both of his children will have a huge cost for school, while his motor-taxi business can only provide food for his family. The income from his billiard business is also unstable. These situations sometimes make him distressed and he tries hard to find another way to generate additional income.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Dikson decided to go to a cooperative to get a loan. He wanted to buy a tent and chairs to rent out. The cooperative offers an attractive package, but the interest remains high. Dikson then heard about TLM&apos;s program from the field officer and got interested in joining the individual program. He is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 10,000,000. He plans to use the loan to develop his leasing business. He expects the loan could help him in improving his business and he can provide easy access to a tent and chairs for the community around his village when they have a party or other events.</en></texts></description><status>in_repayment</status><funded_amount>1125</funded_amount><paid_amount>547.86</paid_amount><image><id>701762</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Party

He started farming back in 1994. Besides farming, Markus also works as a builder to generate additional income for his family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Markus is the father of three children, namely: Desy, who is 15 and studying in the first grade of Senior high school; George, who is 9 and studying in the third grade of elementary school; and Felix, who is aged 2. As the head of the household, Markus is responsible for the happiness of his family. He would do anything that he can for his family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Markus plants mustard greens, &apos;kangkung&apos; (leafy vegetable), peanuts and corn on his farm. As a farmer, Markus relies on the weather to succeed with his harvest. The erratic weather and limited capital have been a challenge for Markus as a farmer. Sometimes he has to suffer from failure at harvest time because of the bad weather, and he couldn’t replace the damaged plants. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Markus really wants to improve his business by purchasing more seeds and a water pump to support him in watering the plants. To do so, Markus is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 4,500,000 from TLM. He believes that the loan will bring a positive change to his business.</en></texts></description><status>in_repayment</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>252.76</paid_amount><image><id>701759</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

They live in their own winter house. He started his car repair service in 2003. His workshop operates 24 hours a day and it is a busy place as the village is located by the main road between the capital city and the western provinces of Mongolia. He is a hard-working and active person who has enough technical knowledge end experience to run the business successfully. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Suhbat wants to enlarge the workshop and upgrade his service. In that way, he hopes to  have more regular customers in the future. He is requesting a loan of 500,000 MNT to buy more spare parts that are useful for his workshop.

His son attends school and his daughter goes to a kindergarten.

Mendbayar is a hard-working and active person who is eager to enlarge his business and open his own workshop in the future. He expects more orders than usual due to Tsagaan Sar, the Mongolian traditional New Year, and is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to get more wood and other necessary materials to make more furniture.

She is the mother of four children whom she loves very much and for whom she works hard every day to ensure she gives them a good education up to the university level. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her business is located at Magongo estate in Mombasa, Kenya. Mombasa is the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many tourist attraction sites, not forgetting the Indian Ocean&apos;s white beaches. She has been selling shawls for the last three years to local people. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is financial constraints.

Ismanbek is known at his local area as an open-hearted and cheerful person, who likes to bring positive emotions to people. Seven years ago, in order to support his family, Ismanbek began his business in selling clothes. He started it with the selling jeans in Russia, but it wasn’t a very profitable activity. Ismanbek redirected his business in selling women’s clothes at the market of Osh. His success as an entrepreneur was achieved due to hard working and strong will in providing his family with all they need. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in the Osh city, Ismanbek lost his business. His small shop was looted and robbed. But Ismanbek, being a very optimistic person, didn’t give up and decided to resume his lost business and continue activities. For this very reason, Ismanbek is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which he needs to restart his activity. With the revenues, Ismanbek plans to improve his living conditions in order to enlarge his family with one more child. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

She started out in her business three years ago, selling pre-paid cell phone cards and then gradually began to stock her business with products such as snacks, soda and basic grains.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Estela tells us that she feels supported by her family since both her husband and her 7 year-old daughter help out in their spare time.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The other members of this group are 47 year-old Lucila G., who sells firewood; Catalina S., who sells tomatoes as an itinerant street vendor and would like to own a spot from which to make her sales; and Arlen H. who has been selling tomatoes for two years.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>775</funded_amount><paid_amount>775</paid_amount><image><id>701967</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery Store</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To buy basic grains</use><location><country_code>NI</country_code><country>Nicaragua</country><town>Managua</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>12.150833 -86.268333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>120</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-28T15:30:07Z</posted_date><loan_amount>775</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Estela</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Lucila</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Arleng</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Catalina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2011-01-21T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>NIO</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>16800</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>775</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-05T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2800</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-21T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2800</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-05T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2800</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-21T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2800</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2800</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-20T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2800</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>129.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>129.16</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>129.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>129.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>129.16</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>129.17</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>259.14</amount><local_amount>5617.52</local_amount><processed_date>2011-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-03-15T11:04:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>5689.45</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>195765235</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>257.53</amount><local_amount>5582.9</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-15T09:55:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>5654.39</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201208399</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>258.33</amount><local_amount>5579.6</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T09:57:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>5651.05</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206077204</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-28T18:14:42Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-05-15T09:57:32Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>269023</id><name>Francis</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Francis lives in Kiambu where he does farming.

Her loan will be used to buy more food supplies and also cassava to make &apos;gari&apos; for sale. She hopes to use the new profits from her business to re-invest back into the food selling business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To prepare &apos;gari&apos;, she gets fresh raw cassava from the market. She washes and peels the cassava, and then sends it to the mill to be milled into dough.&#13;&#10;She puts the dough in a sack and places heavy stones or wood on it. The stones are placed to drain the starch out of the dough. She leaves the dough for a day or two depending on the weight of the stones.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After this process, she stir-fries the &apos;gari&apos; in a pan on a fire. The &apos;gari&apos; is then left to cool and bagged in small bags for sale. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&apos;Gari&apos; is a starchy food  that is mostly enjoyed by students and large families in Ghana. Students eat &apos;gari&apos; a lot because it is a quick and easy food to prepare. They soak &apos;gari&apos; mix with condensed milk and water and sometimes add peanuts. Some students also prepare &apos;gari&apos; in the form of dough and eat it with pepper sauce and sardines.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Families also eat &apos;gari&apos; for lunch or supper, usually served with soup or pepper sauce.

Cabe mencionar que Pinotepa fue una de las zonas mas ricas de la época prehispánica y colonial, existen datos y vestigios de que en Pinotepa se obtenían los mejores telares, la producción del cacao, sal, algodón, guajolotes, grana cochinilla y el añil, así como diferentes plumajes de aves que habitaron en la zona, todavía podemos observar en sus alrededores que los pueblos indígenas producen telares de cintura teñidos con caracol marino púrpura, uno de los logros obtenidos en la actualidad es la producción de calzados de diseños exclusivos por parte de la marca converse, sabemos que es en la población de Pinotepa de don Luis, a unos 30 minutos de Pinotepa nacional. &#10;¡Pero bueno!...después de esta reseña histórica nos enfocaremos a hablar de este grupo de crédito, integrado por 10 mujeres de esta población, su líder se llama: Ana Liz Nicolás A., pero en especifico hablaremos de Lucia Matilde O. Nicolás, ella es una joven de 26 años de edad, es soltera y actualmente vive con sus padres, se dedica a la venta de productos naturistas tales como suplementos alimenticios entre otros. &#10;Lucia desde hace mas de 2 años que inicio con esta actividad, primero consumiendo estos productos, después recomendándolos y distribuyéndolo a la gente, en su testimonio ella nos dice que por un problema de salud inicio el consumo de estos productos mas tarde al ver mejoría en su problema decidió por empezar a venderlos y recomendarlos a la gente, al principio dice que era difícil pero mas tarde se fue haciendo de su clientela hasta colocar su negocio en el lugar que esta actualmente, ella nos comparte que le va muy bien en su negocio y que cada día ha ido mejorando.&#10;Lucia se integro  a un grupo de crédito con el fin de obtener un préstamo de dinero para comprar algunos productos que le hacían falta, ella con este crédito pudo comprar malteadas, fibra, vitaminas, bebidas energizantes, aloe, tratamientos para la gastritis y otros problemas de salud.&#10;Lucia, aspira una casa propia, su esperanza es que su negocio siga creciendo que las ventas no decaigan, porque ella lo que quiere es tener un establecimiento que sea propio para ya no pagar mas rentas, ella nos dice que también le gustaría casarse y tener sus hijos pero no sin antes garantizar la comodidad y el bienestar de ella en primer plano. &#10;Agradece enormemente a Fundacion realidad por la oportunidad que le brinda al financiar su crédito y que más adelante le sigan ofreciendo su apoyo, porque de no ser por ellos mucha gente solo truncaría sus sueños y proyectos. &#10;&#10; “Pinotecpan” es un grupo conformado por un total de 10 mujeres, que enseguida se dan a conocer los nombres de las integrantes, así como su actividad personal de cada uno.&#10;&#10;Guadalupe M.

The members of the group decided on this name, because of the etymology of Pinotepa; this was the name the town was known by in the colonial era, and it means, &quot;Place where the Pinome lords have their palaces.&quot; Pinomes are said to be a savage race that lived here before the conquests of Mesoamerica, and according to research, they came from the northern part of the country and had some qualities from the Sioux indians, also known as the Cherokee. The Pinomes were subjugated by the Mexica/Aztecs, to whom they paid tribute, and who gave them this name. They were thereafter conquered by the Zapoteca culture and finally by the Mixteca, who controlled this area until the Spanish arrived, bringing African slaves and other customs.&#13;&#10;It should be noted that Pinotepa was one of the richest areas during the pre-Hispanic and colonial eras; information exists that in Pinotepa, they had the best weaving, production of cocoa, salt, cotton, turkeys, cochineal, and indigo, as well as various bird feathers from those living in the area. We can still observe in the surrounding area that the indigenous towns produce woven belts made with purple snail dye. Currently some of the goods made here are exclusively designed Converse footwear, made in Pinotepa de don Luis, 30 minutes from Pinotepa Nacional.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After this historical overview, we will shift focus to the group, made up of 10 women from this neighborhood. Their leader is Ana Liz N. A., but this request focuses specifically on Lucia Matilde O. N., a young woman, 26 years old, single and living with her parents. She works selling natural products, including food supplements. Lucia started this business two years ago, first using these products, then recommending and distributing them. In her testimony she indicates that she started using these products because of a health problem, and after seeing her health improve, she decided to start selling them and recommending them to people. Initially it was difficult, but she began gaining more customers, until reaching the current level. She says that the business is doing well, and improving every day.&#13;&#10;Lucia joined a credit group in order to obtain money to buy some products she needed. With this loan she was able to purchase, shakes, vitamins, energy drinks, aloe, treatments for gastritis and other health problems. &#13;&#10;Lucia dreams of a house of her own. She hopes that her business will continue growing, that her sales don&apos;t fall, because she would like to have her own location, where she would no longer have to pay rent. She says that she would also like to get married and have children, but not before first ensuring her comfort and well-being.&#13;&#10;She is very grateful to Fundacion for the opportunity to obtain this loan, and hopes to continue to receive their support in the future, because without them, many people would have to give up their dreams and projects.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&quot;Pinotecpan&quot; is a group of 10 women, their names and businesses are as follows:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Guadalupe M.
