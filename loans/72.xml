She runs a stall selling a variety of grocery products and earns approximately $6.20 a day of profit. Two of her daughters are garment workers earning around $70 dollars each month, and the other son works in Korea, generally earning around $700 dollars a month. Mrs. Eeng K. hopes to use this loan to purchase small cow to resell. People in provinces like buying small cows and reselling them when they grow up because it produces profit. Mrs. Eeng K. plans to use the profits from the cow to help her daughter open a stand selling a variety of spices.

Together they work on their rice paddy, growing crops and vegetables, making on average around $2 a day. Additionally, three of Mrs. S.’s children work in a factory, one is hairdresser, and two others work as waiters. This couple hopes to use this loan to purchase a water pump, fertilizer and feed. If Mrs. Pech S. had a water pump, she would use it to pump the water from the lake into her field in the dry season so that they could produce more yields and water the crops. By buying a water pump, she can farm both seasons on her rice field. This couple also plans to raise fish when they have enough

Being the only bread-winner, she is working hard. As any mother, she wants her children to have everything they need and dreams that all of them shall have higher education.

She is 40 years old, married, and has 2 children. She is in the business of cattle breeding and agriculture. These are the main sources of income for her family. Agricultural activities tend to be seasonal, so for this reason she is asking for loan to finance her cattle business. She plans to purchase a milk cow at a low price as in February they tend to drop down due to lack of food. This will give her an opportunity to get a good price and continuously have milk for both her family and for sales. She plans to pay off the loan within 12 months.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Махмудова Холисхон проживает в районе Рудаки, 40 лет ,замужем имеет 2 детей.Занимается животноводством и сельским хозяйством.Это основные источники дохода ее семьи. Сельское хозяйство является сезонным бизнесом, поэтому данный кредит клиентка запрашивает на животноводство. Она планирует на эти деньги купить дойную корову подешевле,т.к в феврале цены на животных падают в связи с нехваткой корма.Это даст возможность выиграть в цене и получать молоко,как для своей семьи так и для продажи.Планирует погасить кредит в течении 12 месяцев.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>127626</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Animal

She plans to purchase 2 young bulls at a low price because during this time of the year the prices go down due to lack of food for these animals. This will give her an opportunity to earn a higher margin by selling the bulls during the spring season at a better price. She plans to pay off the loan within 12 months.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Кенджаева Рано проживает в районе Рудаки, 45 лет , замужем имеет 3 детей.Занимается животноводством , покупает по более дешевой цене и продает по более выгодной цене.

He is 40 years old and is married with 4 children. He raises livestock and brings in additional money by providing repair services. These are main sources of income for his family. Rajabali applied for a loan to use it to expand his livestock: he plans to purchase the calves in February, when the prices are low. He will fatten them and will sell them in the spring at a higher price. He is planning to repay his loan within 15 months.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Jamilya &amp; Keith Leitich, Kiva Volunteers. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Худжаев Раджабали проживает в районе Рудаки, 40 лет , женат имеет 4 детей.Занимается животноводством, а также зарабатывает деньги путем оказания ремонтных услуг.Это основные источники дохода его семьи. Данный кредит клиент запрашивает на животноводство. Он планирует на эти деньги купить двух бычков подешевле,т.к в феврале цены на животных падают в связи с нехваткой корма.Это даст возможность выиграть в цене и продать бычков весной по более выгодной цене. Запрашиваемый кредит планирует погасить в течении 15 месяцев.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>127637</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Animal

He has been in the animal husbandry business for the past six years. His family helps him take care of the livestock. The cow house is located on a wide farm-yard near his house. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;His current business is very stable and has a good capital turnover. His business consists of buying, feeding and growing and then selling of cattle. The profits grow more with each month and he uses part of the profits to support his family and the rest to reinvest into his business to buy fodder for the cattle. As you can see on the photo, the cow house is a bit small and Akmal wants to build a new one. In the future, he wants to increase the number of livestock, but there&apos;s a small problem with the premises. A credit counselor advised him to apply for a loan with Kiva. He hopes to receive a loan soon and promises that he will pay it off within 10 months.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Акмал,достаточно опытный знаток своего дела.Животноводством он занимается уже 6 лет и семья помогает ему ухаживать за скотом.Его коровник расположен дома, широкий двор и уютный коровник.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Его текущий бизнес достаточно стабилен и он имеет хороший оборот капитала.Его бизнес это купля,откорм и продажа скота.  Его активы возрастают ежемесячно и  часть прибыли он тратит на семейные нужды, а другую часть тратит на покупку корма быкам.Как видно на фото его коровник немного маловат и он хочет построить новый коровник. В будущем он хочет увеличить количество скота, но проблема в помещении.Кредитный эксперт посоветовал ему участвовать в КИВА программе и он очень надеется на получение займа с КИВА и обязуется оплатить его в течении 10 месяцев.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1175</funded_amount><paid_amount>1175</paid_amount><image><id>127699</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Livestock</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

In this type of group loan, the money is divided among each woman to invest in her own business. They guarantee each other&apos;s loans, so that if one woman can&apos;t repay it, the others will cover her share. With her portion, Betty K. will buy equipment for her beauty salon, and  Harriet B. will start a retail shop.

She earns a living selling charcoal, making about $10,000 Ugandan shillings (the equivalent of $9 U.S. dollars) each week. In order to pay for her children&apos;s mandatory school fees, Catherine hopes to expand her business. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Catherine has applied for a loan of $1,200 U.S. dollars along with four other women. Ayoa has taken out a loan before and paid it back on time, so she is confident that she will be able to repay this one as well. In this type of group loan, the money is divided among each woman to invest in her own business. They guarantee each other&apos;s loans, so that if one woman can&apos;t repay it, the others will cover her share. Eva M. wants to grow her retail shop; Ruth K. hopes to grow her fish market; Norah N. plans on buying more fruit for her produce stand; and Miranda B. wants to build up her charcoal-selling

She runs a small pharmacy, while her husband is a teacher. Ayoa hopes to expand her business; with the extra profits, she plans on meeting basic needs, such as home repairs, mandatory school fees for her children, and clothing. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ayoa has applied for a loan of $1,300 U.S. dollars along with four other women. Ayoa has taken out a loan before and paid it back on time, so she is confident that she will be able to repay this one as well. In this type of group loan, the money is divided among each woman to invest in her own business. They guarantee each other&apos;s loans, so that if one woman can&apos;t repay it, the others will cover her share. Fidah M. has a business in charcoal selling and wants to expand it, while Lydia A. hopes to buy a fridge for her bar. Asiya N. grows matooke, or green bananas (a popular food stape in Uganda), and wants to buy more supplies to plant more crops. Lastly,  Ayoa N. wishes to buy more stock for her food-selling shop.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1300</funded_amount><paid_amount>1300</paid_amount><image><id>127750</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Medical

She makes a living by running a poultry business in Kamuli, Uganda, and wishes to buy more merchandise to expand her store. Currently, she earns $25,0000 Ugandan shillings, or $12 U.S. dollars, each week; with the extra profits, she plans on covering basic needs like shelter. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Monic has applied for a loan of $1,300 U.S. dollars along with three other women. In this type of group loan, the money is divided among each woman to invest in her own business. They guarantee each other&apos;s loans, so that if one woman can&apos;t repay it, the others will cover her share. Veronica M. wishes to grow her retail store, while Jackie N. hopes to expand her sweet potato company. With her portion, Olivia N. wants to buy a poultry feeder for her poultry business. Monic has taken out a loan before and paid it back on time, so she is confident that she will be able to repay this one as well.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1300</funded_amount><paid_amount>1300</paid_amount><image><id>127761</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Poultry</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

She makes a living by running a battery charging business Kamuli, Uganda, and wishes to buy a large battery. Currently, she earns $25,0000 Ugandan shillings, or $15 U.S. dollars, each week. With the extra profits, she plans on covering basic needs, such as home repairs. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane has applied for a loan of $1,300 U.S. dollars along with three other women. In this type of group loan, the money is divided among each woman to invest in her own business. They guarantee each other&apos;s loans, so that if one woman can&apos;t repay it, the others will cover her share. Besi M. wishes to buy a fridge for her retail shop, Justine K. wants to buy cloth for her tailoring store, while Mwajuma A. hopes to grow her poultry business. Edith has taken out a loan before and paid it back on time, so she is confident that she will be able to repay this one as well.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1300</funded_amount><paid_amount>1300</paid_amount><image><id>127767</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Spare

She and her husband make a living by running a retail store in Kamuli, Uganda, and wish to buy more merchandise to expand her store. With the extra profits, she hopes to start a new business. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Justine has applied for a loan of $825 U.S. dollars along with two other women. In this type of group loan, the money is divided among each woman to invest in her own business. They guarantee each other&apos;s loans, so that if one woman can&apos;t repay it, the others will cover her share. Sarah Namulida wants to grow her charcoal selling business, while Betty Nakianda hopes to purchase a fridge for her small brewery. Justine has taken out a loan before and paid it back on time, so she is confident that she will be able to repay this one as well.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>825</funded_amount><paid_amount>825</paid_amount><image><id>127774</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home Products

With the extra profits, she plans on covering basic needs, such as home repairs, clothes, and mandatory school fees. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane has applied for a loan of $825 U.S. dollars along with two other women. In this type of group loan, the money is divided among each woman to invest in her own business. They guarantee each other&apos;s loans, so that if one woman can&apos;t repay it, the others will cover her share. Ruth B. hopes to grow her grocery store, and Lovisa K. wants to expand her retail shop. Jane has taken out a loan before and paid it back on time, so she is confident that she will be able to repay this one as

With her share of the loan, she wishes to buy more stock to expand her store. She&apos;s taken out  loan before to kickstart her business, and paid it back in full and on time. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Annet is investing in a loan of $900 U.S. dollars with three other women. In this type of group loan, the funds are distributed among the members, each of whom invests in her own business. They all guarantee each other&apos;s loans, so if one member can&apos;t repay, the others are responsible. Margret A. wants to grow her business trading produce, while Monica N. wishes to do the same with her grocery store. Lastly, Annet B. also wants to develop her grocery

They range in age from 2 to 18 years old. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;That&apos;s why she has applied for a $1,100 loan with three other women. In a group loan, the funds are distributed among the members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members guarantee each other&apos;s loans, so if one member can&apos;t repay, the others are responsible. Fida N. wants to grow her business, while Scovia B. wishes to start selling sweet potatoes. Lastly, Jawuda I. hopes to buy more clothes to expand her retail

type="list"><language>fr</language></languages><texts><fr>Mrs. Aminata D. is a 30 year old married woman and mother of 4 children. She lives in a polygamous family with another one of her husband’s wives. Her husband, Mr. Bahama Soumaré, is a cattle farmer.  From the youngest age, Aminata was already helping her parents in the cattle farming business and the marketing of milk.  As a result, Aminata has mastered all the details of this activity. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Before joining the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso,  Aminata was having trouble feeding her cows well. So she decided to join the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso through an association of interdependent (group) loans. After a two-year experience in the association, she moved on to an individual loan. She is now on her second loan. All the previous loans were properly paid back.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Aminata D. stocks up in cattle feed (20 to 25 bags) in Bamako to be transported to Sanankoroba. Her herd consumes part of it, and the other part is sold to other cattle farmers. This operation is repeated every week.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;On average, she makes a profit of 500 FCFA (~USD 1.5) per bag, or 40.000 FCFA (~USD 23) per month.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Véronique Fourment, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;•&#9;Madame Aminata D. est une femme mariée de 30 ans et mère de 04 enfants. Elle vit dans une famille polygame avec une coépouse. Son mari Mr Bahama Soumaré est éleveur. Dès son jeune age, elle aidait déjà ses parents dans les activités d’élevage et de commercialisations de lait. De ce fait  Aminata maîtrise cette activité dans son détail et sa spécificité.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;•&#9;Avant d’intégrer le programme de crédit de Soro Yiriwaso, Madame Aminata avait des difficultés pour bien nourrir ses vaches qui ne pouvaient pas produire alors une quantité suffisante de lait pour la commercialisation. Ainsi  elle  a décidé d’intégrer le programme de crédit de Soro Yiriwaso à travers une association de crédit solidaire. Après une expérience de deux ans en association, elle a passé au prêt individuel et est à son deuxième prêt. Tous les prêts précédents se sont correctement dénoués.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;•&#9;Madame Aminata D. s’approvisionne en aliment bétail (20 à 25 sacs) à Bamako pour acheminer à Sanankoroba. Une partie est consommée par son troupeau et l’autre partie est vendue aux autres éleveurs. Cette opération est renouvelée chaque semaine.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;•&#9;Elle réalise en moyenne un bénéfice de 500 FCFA (~USD 1,5) par sac soit 40.000 FCFA (~USD 23) par mois.&lt;p&gt;</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>127808</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Animal

He lives in the village of Saatli town in the south-central flat area of Azerbaijan Republic in the Caucasus region. Vasif and his wife (who is pictured) run the family business together. Vasif&apos;s wife cares for their only cow, while Vasif sells the cow&apos;s milk in town. Unfortunately, the income generated from the one cow is insufficient to support the family. Therefore, he is seeking a loan of $500 from the Norwegian Microcredit Saatli branch to buy one more pure-bred cow, which would increase the business&apos;s monthly income. In the Caucasus region the price of a good cow is approximately $800-$1,000, so he would supplement the money he hopes to receive from the the Norwegian Microcredit Saatli branch with his own funds to enable him to purchase another cow.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>127828</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Dairy</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

She is the mother of 7 children (the oldest is 26 and the youngest 6 years old). Of her 7 children, six are in school. She lives with her husband and some of her children in the village of Mana.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Elisabeth’s main activity is market gardening.  She has over ten (10) years of experience in this field and she has mastered all the market gardening methods. In the three hectares she works just behind her house, she grows lettuce, onions, cabbage, chili, tomato, and eggplant.  She has also planted a lot of papaya shoots. This production is sold off in the market of Ouelessebougou, a town close to Elisabeth’s village, except for the chili, which are sold in Bamako (the capital of Mali). This activity generates a profit of 120.000 FCFA (~USD 267) per cycle of market gardening (six months period). For each weekly transaction Elisabeth makes an average net profit of 35.000 FCFA 35.000 FCFA (~USD 78) or 140.000 FCFA (~USD 312) per month.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Elisabeth Djoné is on her 16th loan with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  She started with an interdependent (group) loan in a women’s association before qualifying for an individual loan. All the loans have been properly repaid. Elisabeth is the initiator of the involvement of over 40 women in the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With the profit she makes, Elisabeth provides for most of the household expenses and takes care of the school fees of three of her children who are in a secondary school in Bamako (the capital of Mali). Finally, she has been able to buy an animal drawn cart.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Véronique Fourment, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;•&#9;Madame Elisabeth Djoné est une femme mariée de 46 ans, mère de 07 enfants (le plus âgé à 26 ans et le plus petit à 06 ans). Sur les sept enfants six fréquentent l’école. Elle vit avec son mari et une partie de ses enfants dans le village de Mana.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;•&#9;Elle exerce le maraîchage comme activité principale. Disposant d’une expérience de plus de dix (10) ans dans le domaine cité, elle maîtrise toutes les techniques du maraîchage. Dans les trois hectares exploités juste derrière sa maison, elle y cultive de la salade, des oignons, des choux, du piment, de la tomate, de l’aubergine. En plus elle a planté beaucoup de pied de Papaye. Cette production est écoulée sur le marché de Ouelessebougou (localité proche du village de résidence d’Elisabeth) sauf pour le piment qui est vendu à Bamako (la capitale du Mali). Cette activité engendre un bénéfice de 120.000 FCFA (~USD 267) par cycle de maraîchage (durée six mois). &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Pour chaque opération hebdomadaire, Madame Elisabeth réalise en moyenne un bénéfice net de 35.000 FCFA 35.000 FCFA (~USD 78) soit 140.000 FCFA (~USD 312) par mois.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;•&#9;Madame Elisabeth Djoné est à son 16e prêt avec l’Institution de Microfinance Soro Yiriwaso. Elle a commencé avec le crédit solidaire (Dans une association de femmes) avant d’obtenir un prêt individuel. Tous les prêts se sont correctement dénoués. Elle est à l’origine de l’intégration de plus de 40 femmes dans le programme de crédit de Soro Yiriwaso.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;•&#9;Avec les bénéfices réalisés elle assure l’essentiel des dépenses de la famille et assure les frais d’éducation scolaires de trois de ses enfants qui fréquentent actuellement des écoles supérieures à Bamako (capitale du Mali). Enfin elle a pu acheté une charrette à traction animale.&lt;p&gt;</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>127839</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Purchase

She lives with her husband and her children in N’Tentou in the town of Ouelessebougou.  Her husband is a retired serviceman and does not have a sufficient income to cover the household expenses.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Traoré abandoned her schooling very early on and took up commercial activities, notably various kinds of trading. However, she has always been brought face to face with the lack of financial means to undertake a large economic endeavor. Upon her husband’s retirement, the family moved to Ouelessebougou, not far from the premises of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. After inquiring she started to take up loans with Soro Yiriwaso through an association before being able to take out an individual loan. She has now taken 7 loans with Soro Yiriwaso.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Rokia Traoré’s family has a store where she stocks cereal bags before reselling them wholesale or retail. She stocks up on the local markets of Dankassa, Sankama, Keleya, Selingué, Faraba, Sidoba and of Ouelessebougou. She carries out a market survey before going to Bamako and selling to wholesalers. Her profit margin is on average 3.000 FCFA (~USD 6) per bag. Her monthly profit is 150.000 FCFA (~USD 333). With the profit she makes, she provides for the most part of the household expenses (health, education, food, etc…)&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her main concern is to properly reimburse the loan from Soro Yiriwaso. She hopes to increase the amount of her loan to increase the size of her business and thus realize more profit. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Véronique Fourment, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;•&#9;Madame Rokia Traoré est une femme mariée de 52 ans, mère de 04 enfants. Elle vit avec son mari et ses enfants à N’Tentou dans la ville de Ouelessebougou. Son mari un ancien militaire est à la retraite et ne dispose pas de ressources financières suffisantes pour assurer les charges familiales.&#13;&#10;•&#9;Ayant vite abandonné l’école dès son jeune Madame Traoré s’est vite adonnée aux activités commerciales notamment le commerce divers. Cependant elle a toujours été confrontée au manque de moyen financier pour mener une activité économique d’une grande taille. A la retraite de son mari, la famille s’est installée à Ouelessebougou non loin des locaux de l’institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso. Après renseignement elle a commencé à prendre des prêts avec Soro Yiriwaso au sein d’une association avant d’arriver au prêt individuel. Elle est à son 7e prêt avec Soro Yiriwaso.&#13;&#10;•&#9;Madame Rokia Traoré dispose d’un magasin dans sa famille où elle stocke ses sacs de céréales avant de les vendre en gros ou en détail. Elle s’approvisionne sur les marchés des localités de Dankassa, Sankama, de Keleya, de Selingué, de Faraba, de Sidoba et de Ouelessebougou. Elle procède à une prospection de marché à Bamako avant d’y aller les vendre à des grossistes. Sa marge bénéficiaire est en moyenne de 3.000 FCFA (~USD 6)   par sac. Son bénéfice mensuel est de 150.000 FCFA (~USD 333). Avec les bénéfices réalisés elle assure l’essentiel des dépenses de la famille (Santé, Education, Nourriture etc…).&#13;&#10;•&#9;Son premier souci est de rembourser correctement le prêt de Soro Yiriwaso. Elle espère augmenter le montant de son prêt pour accroître la taille de son affaire et  réaliser ainsi plus de bénéfice.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>127845</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase

She is twenty-seven years old and has four children.  Her husband lives outside the country and visits the family only rarely.  Tereza says her business is very profitable because she buys a bedspread at 600 Dominican pesos and resells it at about 1000 pesos or more (USD 1.00 = 34 pesos).  &lt;P&gt;Until now, the entrepreneur has been running her business out of her rented house but she says she will keep doing business in order that she can finish her own house which is being built in the same community.  Tereza will use her loan to purchase more bedspreads in order to increase her income.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>127854</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home Products Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Purchase of a large quantity of bedspreads to resell in her community</use><location><country_code>DO</country_code><country>Dominican Republic</country><town>Yamasa</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>18.783333 -70.05</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>66</partner_id><posted_date>2008-02-12T17:20:12Z</posted_date><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Tereza</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-02-26T23:09:30Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>DOP</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>10000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-03-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-04-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-05-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-06-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1666.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>1666.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-03-27T10:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-27T09:17:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1706.9</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>167434</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>1666.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-04-27T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-27T09:17:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1706.9</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>193267</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>1666.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-27T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-27T09:17:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1706.9</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>221087</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>1666.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-06-27T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-27T09:17:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1706.9</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>250277</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>1666.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-27T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-27T09:17:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1706.9</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>278862</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>1666.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-27T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-27T09:17:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1706.9</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>308395</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-02-12T23:09:30Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-08-27T09:17:43Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>35825</id><name>Saidat</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Saidat A. is 28 years old, is married, and has 2 children.

ages. She owns her own market stand, which was a costly investment. She puts all of her effort into every day&apos;s work because of that investment and because her business is her family&apos;s only source of income.  &lt;p&gt;The business started with few clients but with the passing time has grown as she has brought in new clients and has been recognized in the village of El Sauce.&lt;p&gt; It is important to point out tha Aura has taken out 6 loans with Ceprodel. The loans have had a great impact; she has improved both her sewing machinery and her quality of life. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desde hace 12 años en la ciudad de Leon específicamente en el pueblo de El Sauce, la señora Aura P. se dedica al negocio de costura de todo tamaño y para todas las edades. Posee un tramo propio el cual le ha costado mucha inversión y por ser el único sustento de su hogar se esfuerza día a día en este trabajo.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;El negocio lo comienza con pocos clientes pero a medida que el tiempo transcurre ha ido mejorando su condición tanto así que ha adquirido nuevos clientes y además ha sido muy reconocida en  el pueblo de El Sauce.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Es necesario destacar que la señora Aura ha realizado 6 créditos en Ceprodel que le han impactado grandemente por el hecho de que ha mejorado sus maquinaria para la costura y además ha mejorado su nivel de vida.&lt;p&gt;</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>375</funded_amount><paid_amount>375</paid_amount><image><id>127872</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Sewing</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Purchase

Sauce. &lt;p&gt;For two years she has been earning her living in her own convenience store, a store she has stocked little by little with a growing variety of products over the years. Mrs. Ramirez currently faces the need to invest in the purchase of  her products. Since she has few resources she wisely turns to Ceprodel for loans which allow her to improve her economic situation and move ahead toward fulfilling her dreams of being an important merchant in the village of El Sauce. &lt;p&gt; Mrs. Rosales also needs to invest in the purchase of soft drinks, juices and water. In order to fill all of these needs she has turned to Ceprodel. Ceprodel has not denied her requests but has provided her with loans she has been wise about investing in the purchase of her products and in savings for improvements to her home. Her credit record is 8 loans over a year and a half. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danelia Ramirez es una dama poseedora de un negocio propio de pulpería ubicado en la ciudad de León específicamente en el pueblo de El Sauce.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Desde hace 2 años se dedica a tener su propia pulpería la cual la ha venido surtiendo de productos poco a poco a medida que van transcurriendo los años. &#13;&#10;Una necesidad que atraviesa la señora R. es que necesita invertir en la compra de sus productos y además de ser de escasos recursos, muy sabiamente acude a Ceprodel para ser beneficiada con créditos que le permitan mejorar su condición económica y así salir adelante para cumplir sus sueños de ser una gran comerciante en el pueblo de El Sauce.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Otra necesidad de la señora Rosales es que debe invertir en la compra de las gaseosas, jugos y agua. Para suplir todas estas necesidades ha recurrido a Ceprodel quien no le ha negado su petición sino que le ha otorgado créditos que los ha sabido invertir en la compra de sus productos y ahorro para la remodelación de su hogar. Su record crediticio es de 8 créditos desde hace un año y medio.

His business is located in the patio of his house, with the advantage of being located in a very busy area. He is also one of few carpenters in his village, El Sauce, in the city of León. &lt;p&gt;The need this gentleman faces is that in order to continue maintaining his humble household (wife and son ) along with his elderly parents, he needs to invest in the purchase of wood and tools in better condition than those he currently uses. This will allow him to continue providing a good service to his clients. For this reason he turns to Ceprodel, to receive the loans that allow him to purchase tools and wood of excellent quality. His credit record with Ceprodel is 4 loans. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eddy S. es un joven que desde muy pequeño ha tenido  la habilidad de trabajar en la carpintería.

Sauce in León. For ten years, he has been working in his own home in a carpentry business in which he crafts all types of furniture which he later sells to his local clients. For some time he has been known for doing very detailed work of high quality. For this reason he feels very committed to improving his quality and maintaining his loyal clientele. With this commitment in mind, he turns to Ceprodel to request another of the loans that have allowed him to purchase the wood and tools he needs for his work. He has been working with Ceprodel for 4 years and feels privileged, since these loans have opened the door to new opportunities to sell his furniture. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guillermo S. es un esforzado caballero originario de la ciudad de León específicamente de el pueblo El Sauce en esta ciudad .Actualmente tiene 10 años de trabajar en su hogar propio en un negocio de carpintería donde elabora todo tipo de muebles para luego venderlos a los clientes de su localidad. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Por mucho tiempo se ha caracterizado por realizar trabajos muy finos y de alta calidad es por esto que se siente muy comprometido en mejorar su calidad y mantener siempre su fiel clientela. Por este motivo acude a Ceprodel para optar por los créditos que le benefician para la compra de la madera y herramientas de trabajo. Actualmente trabaja con CEPRODEL desde hace 4 años y se siente muy beneficiado debido a que por medio de estos créditos se le han abierto puertas de oportunidades para vender sus

which offer these products. Being conscious of this, Alejos A. devotes himself to the sale of hardware products in the village of Villanueva in Chinadega in Nicaragua.&#13;&#10;Before having the business he used to sell lottery tickets, walking through the streets of Villanueva, however due to low income he decided to invest in the purchase of hardware products.  On having an equipped business site, he decided to invest in his business and it is for this reason he has made use of credits authorised for Ceprodel which he recounts have benefited him enormously in the purchase of new materials to sell and to maintain his immediate family.&#13;&#10;It is important to record that since he started receiving these credits, he has been a faithful client paying back on time and in full. His dream is to expand his business and to provide his children with a better lifestyle.&#13;&#10;Translated from the Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer&#13;&#10; La venta de productos ferreteros es un negocio muy competitivo ya que existen muchas ferreterías que ofertan tales productos. Consiente de esta situación, el señor Alejos A. se dedica al negocio de venta de productos ferreteros en el pueblo de Villanueva de la ciudad de Chinandega en nicaragua.&#13;&#10;Antes de tener el negocio se dedicaba a vender loteria ambulante por las calles de Villanueva, sin embargo por motivos de bajos ingresos decide invertir en la compra de productos ferreteros. Al tener el local acondicionado decide invertir en su negocio y es por esta razón es que hace uso de los créditos otorgados por Ceprodel que según cuenta le han beneficiado grandemente en la compra de nuevos materiales de venta y para mantener su núcleo familiar.&#13;&#10;Es importante señalar que desde que inició con estos créditos, ha sido un fiel cliente pagándolos en tiempo y forma. Su mayor sueño es ampliar su negocio y brindarle un mejor estilo de vida a sus hijos.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>127906</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home

Her dearest wish is that her son can be educated to be a professional and won’t suffer as she considers she suffered from a very young age with heavy work.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It’s necessary to state that Maria Auxiliadora F. currently doesn’t have a permanent business site, so sells her products in Villanueva park.  For this reason she approached CEPRODEL in order to become a beneficiary of credits which she will be able to invest in the purchase of stock and also in the improvement of her business area.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from the Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Maria Auxiliadora F. es una dama muy trabajadora que desde hace 20 años se dedica a la venta de frutas en la ciudad de Villanueva de la bella ciudad de Chinandega en Nicaragua.

city of&#13;&#10;Chinandega in Nicaragua.  She has made herself known for being a&#13;&#10;hardworking person because every day she takes care of her store.  &lt;p&gt;She is&#13;&#10;a married and a mother of two minor children.  She and her husband work&#13;&#10;hard to pay for their childrens’ schooling and to give them a better life&#13;&#10;style.  &lt;p&gt;To increase her earnings and to provide for her immediate family,&#13;&#10;Neptalia is asking for help from Ceprodel who has given her loans to&#13;&#10;purchase merchandise for her business.  It’s important to emphasise that&#13;&#10;since Villanueva is such a small town, she is the only person who sells&#13;&#10;these medicines and that is why she really needs to aquire these&#13;&#10;products.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Nikki of San Roque High School, Kiva volunteer &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;div align=&apos;justify&apos;&gt; &#13;&#10;Neptalia E. desde hace 20 años se dedica al negocio de venta de medicamentos teniendo su propia farmacia en el pueblo de Villanueva de la ciudad de Chinandega en Nicaragua. Ella se ha caracterizado por ser una persona muy esforzada y trabajadora debido a que todos los días atiende en su puesto de venta.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Es madre casada y con dos hijos a su cargo el cual junto con su esposo lucha para mantener sus estudios y brindarles un mejor estilo de vida a sus pequeños.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Para incrementar sus ingresos y así mantener su núcleo familiar, la señora Neptalia busca apoyo en Ceprodel quien le ha brindado créditos para surtir su negocio y ser una gran comerciante. Es necesario destacar que por ser Villanueva un pequeño pueblo ella es la única persona que vende estos medicamentos por lo que urge la adquisición de tales

With the loan and his savings, he purchased a second used vehicle for the same purpose.  He made good money and has rehabilitated the house inherited from his father.  The first vehicle is now old, so he plans to buy another to replace it and is requesting $1,200 to add on the savings for this purpose.

In that time, they have learned responsibility, how to improve their businesses, and the importance of saving.&lt;/P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Candelaria is 47 years old. She is married and has five children between the ages of six and twenty-three. Candelaria has two businesses. She has been selling veterinary and agricultural products for several years.  One year ago, she started selling clothing in order to have a more steady income during non-planting seasons. Previously, she owned a small store but her husband took it, and she has since left him. She hopes to open a new store in the future.&lt;/P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Julia is 35 years old. She is married and has three children. She travels for two to three hours to buy products at regional markets, and then she sells them in the city of Ayacucho. Julia sells food staples, such as flour, sugar, and oil. She also sells soft drinks and coca leaves, which are used for tea.&lt;/P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Candelaria and Juilia need loans of 600 and 1000 soles (3 soles = $1), which they will use to but clothing, fertilizer, seeds, animal feed, coca, wheat, and candies.&lt;/P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;One of the most important aspects of the community bank is the interest-earning savings account each associate has.  Candelaria and Julia plan to use their savings to increase the capital available to their businesses, open a store, and improve their homes. Their dreams are to eventually own a home and have large businesses, and hope that their children will have a better life.&lt;/P&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>575</funded_amount><paid_amount>575</paid_amount><image><id>127981</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Veterinary Sales</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Candelaria and Juilia need loans of 600 and 1000 soles (3 soles = $1), which they will use to buy clothing, fertilizer, seeds, animal feed, coca, wheat, and candies.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Ayacucho</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-13.158333 -74.223889</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>70</partner_id><posted_date>2008-02-13T09:40:06Z</posted_date><loan_amount>575</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Candelaria</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Julia Rosario</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-02-27T19:04:29Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1600</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>575</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-03-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-04-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-05-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-06-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>143.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>143.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>143.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>143.75</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>144</amount><local_amount>400.7</local_amount><processed_date>2008-03-27T10:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-06-27T09:10:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>418.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>167450</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>144</amount><local_amount>400.7</local_amount><processed_date>2008-04-27T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-06-27T09:10:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>418.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>193292</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>144</amount><local_amount>400.7</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-27T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-06-27T09:10:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>418.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>221111</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>143</amount><local_amount>397.91</local_amount><processed_date>2008-06-27T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-06-27T09:10:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>415.83</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>250308</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-02-13T19:04:29Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-06-27T09:10:58Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>35882</id><name>Ana Antonia</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>Ana V. is a single mother who works with zeal to&#13;&#10;be able to put food on the table in her humble home. &#13;&#10;She lives in El Sauce.

She needs money for the materials and&#13;&#10;construction and the labor before the rainy season&#13;&#10;comes, because whenever it comes around her house ends&#13;&#10;up flooded. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;For this reason, Mrs. V. has come to Ceprodel&#13;&#10;for help.  Ceprodel has already begun to help her with&#13;&#10;loans that have allowed her to purchase materials for&#13;&#10;construction and have allowed her to give her son an&#13;&#10;improved home and quality of life.  Now she needs a&#13;&#10;little more in order to complete her home improvement&#13;&#10;project.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Edith of San Roque High School, Kiva volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;div align=&apos;justify&apos;&gt; &#13;&#10;Ana V. es madre soltera que con gran ahínco se esfuerza para llevar el sustento a su humilde hogar de habitación en El Sauce.

home is in.  She is the mother of two school-aged&#13;&#10;children.  They are the reason why she works so hard every day.  She is a&#13;&#10;teacher’s aide at a primary school and she wants to give her children the&#13;&#10;best life possible.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Presently she has started making much needed improvements and repairs to&#13;&#10;her home.  Her home’s floor and roof were in terrible conditions.  Also,&#13;&#10;the walls were deteriorating and for that reason Arlen is looking for a&#13;&#10;way to improve the conditions of her home.  Ceprodel has provided Arlen&#13;&#10;with loans to be able to buy materials to improve the conditions of her&#13;&#10;home.  Her greatest need now is to continue investing in the improvement&#13;&#10;of her home so that she will be able to raise the level of living for&#13;&#10;herself and her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Kendra of San Roque High School, Kiva volunteer &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;div align=&apos;justify&apos;&gt; &#13;&#10;Arlen Gamez es una dama que por mucho tiempo ha atravesado una problemática como lo es el mal estado de la infraestructura de su casa. Es madre de dos hijos en edad escolar y según comenta ellos son el motivo por el cual se esfuerza día a día en su trabajo de docencia de educación primaria para brindarles buenas condiciones de vida a sus pequeños.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Actualmente ha iniciado poco a poco a remodelar su hogar ya que tenía problemáticas por lo que no contaba con piso y el techo estaba en malas condiciones. Además las paredes estaban deterioradas y por tal motivo es que busca la manera de mejorar esta situación y lo ha realizado por medio de los créditos brindados en Ceprodel alcanzando a comprar parte de los materiales de construcción para la remodelación de su hogar. Actualmente su mayor necesidad es continuar invirtiendo en su hogar para mejorar sus condiciones de vida y la de los

She is married and has two teenage children. Her eldest is studying architecture at the university and her youngest is still in high school. Maria is a member of the “Kantuta” community bank . She has belonged for eight months. In that time, she has learned the importance of saving.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Maria owns a dessert shop and café. Previously, she owned a restaurant, but changed two years ago because she enjoys desserts.

Gracias a su empeño y   compromiso viene sacando adelante   su fábrica y  al observar que tenían una gran cantidades de solicitudes   y  no podían abastecer a todos   sus clientes decidieron contratar a dos  trabajadores para cumplir satisfactoriamente con las demandas de sus clientes. En estos momentos  esta laboriosa pareja se siente muy  satisfecha por los resultados que está obteniendo poco a poco con su incansable labor.  El deseo que tiene  doña margarita  es ofrecerle   un techo propio y seguro  a su querido hijo, Daniel, quien  es  su mayor alegría y orgullo.  En esta oportunidad  requiere obtener un préstamo de  dinero para invertirlos en la compra de  insumos para su ladrillera y con las ganancias que obtenga  adquirir un terrenito para construir su

Since she was a little girl, she would help her parents in the making or construction of bricks.  Thanks to her acquired knowledge over the years, she has been able to manage a very successful brick making business which she inherited from her parents.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With this job, she was able to support and to pay for her children&apos;s education.  She took care of her 2 beloved children all by herself, after separating from her husband.  Today, even though she&apos;s a little bit older, she still has the same strength, eargerness and will-power to succeed.  This is why she still works non-stop making all types of bricks.  Felicitas dream is to expand her business even more.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She&apos;s requesting for your assistance.  She commits in repaying this loan within 6 months and she promises to pay you on time.  &quot;Felicitas awaits for your promising answer.&quot;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Carolina Zelaya-Kronlund, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Doña Felícitas, proviene de una familia muy trabajadora y emprendedora, desde que tuvo  uso de razón siempre apoyó a sus padres en su noble labor de ladrilleros,  gracias  a los conocimientos y a la experiencia que adquirió durante  muchos años  ha  logrado sacar adelante  la  fábrica  que heredó de sus padres.Con este noble oficio logró educar  y brindarles bienestar a sus queridos hijos, por quienes   se esforzó y veló constantemente desde que decidió separarse de su esposo y hacerse cargo de  sus dos queridos retoños.Actualmente, pese a su avanzada edad  sigue conservando la  misma fuerza, voluntad, y ganas de superación, es por eso que  sigue trabajando incansablemente  elaborando una inmensa variedad de  ladrillos.El deseo que tiene  Felícitas  es   incrementar aún más  su negocio, con este fin  recorre en búsqueda de  tu apoyo  y hace la solicitud de un préstamo  que se compromete  a  retornarlo en un lapso de seis meses y además promete ser puntual en el pago.“Felicitas,  espera  tu respuesta

Now, with a little bit more experience and agility, they are able to make daily about 150 pullovers or sweaters and vests.  They sell them at whole prices at the local market in her native city of San Jose and in the city of Desaguadero.  The demand is very high due to the good quality and great workmanship.

The area does not have a sewer system.  There is a shortage of water and the streets are not paved.  The housing conditions of the lady are very humble.  She has many limitations due to the fact that she can not rely on having the necessary resources to improve the infrastructure of her dwelling.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ana Julia’s life companion works in the duty-free zone of operative.  The pay that he receives is very little and does not cover even half of the basic food needs of the children. Being in this difficult situation, the lady has decided to rent rooms at low prices to people from other areas, with the objective of having a monthly income and in this way she can meet all the family expenses.  With this activity the lady assures that her children will have food.  This is how her family will subsist and move forward, despite the difficult economic situation in the country.  At this time Ana Julia needs a loan to improve the condition of the rooms that she rents.  She wants to refinish the walls, to cover certain holes that they have and to paint them, to give a better appearance to the rooms so that she can come to receive a better income from them.  &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;La señora Ana Julia tiene 37 años de edad, vive con su compañero de vida, tiene 4 hijos, los cuales todos se encuentran estudiando en primaria y secundaria, habita en el asentamiento Villa Reconciliación, un barrio rural, muy pobre, marginado, las viviendas de los pobladores son construidas de zinc, plástico y/o madera, no tiene alcantarillado, existe escasez de agua, las calles no están pavimentadas.

Con esta actividad la señora asegura la alimentación de sus hijos, es así como esta familia subsiste y sale adelante, pese a la dura situación económica en la que se encuentra el país.  En estos momentos la señora requiere un préstamo para acondicionar mejor los cuartos que alquila, desea darle un fino a las paredes, tapar ciertos agujeros que poseen y pintarlos, para darle una mejor

characteristics.  She&apos;s a mother of two young children.  She has been through a lot of hard times including physical abuse from her first living partner. At that time, it was her first child, Juan who&apos;s now 10 years old, who gave her motivation to move ahead.  With the savings she had, she decided to purchase a shoe sewing machine and opened a workshop where she put in practice everthing her father had taught her about sewing shoes.  Thanks to her hard work, dedication and great workmanship, she has been able to manage a succesful business and was able to built her own house.  After 8 years of being separated from her first partner, she decided to give herself a second chance at love.  She thought she knew this person, but at the end it didn&apos;t work out.  She did have a little girl from this relationship.  Flor de Maria decided to give herself to her business and to try to make it even more successful.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She has hired 3 workers who give her all the support she needs while she takes care of all the distribution.  Due to her huge motivation to move ahead and her huge clientele, she now realizes she needs to request for a loan.  &quot;Your assistance will be a good investment in the hands of this hard-working mother.&quot;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Carolina Zelaya-Kronlund, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;El empeño,  voluntad,  y las innumerables ganas de superación de Flor de María, son sus principales características, ella es madre de dos pequeños niños,  en el transcurso de su vida ha   pasado  por muchos momentos  de privaciones  y angustias,  sufrió  los maltratos físicos y posterior   abandono de su primera pareja, desde entonces  solo tenía una razón para progresar su pequeño niño Juan de  10 años.Con los ahorros que tenía decidió comprar una máquina de coser calzados para  abrir su taller de   fabricación de zapatos poniendo en práctica los conocimientos adquiridos de su padre en esta labor.Gracias  a su esfuerzo, perseverancia, sus excelentes   trabajos  y novedosos modelos de calzados ha  logrado tener éxito  y ha  podido   construir  su propia casita.  Ahora   después de ocho años  de haberse separado de su primer compromiso decidió darse una segunda oportunidad,  creyó conocer  a la persona  perfecta con el que tuvo  una pequeña niña,   desafortunadamente  las cosas tampoco resultaron y después de este segundo episodio Flor de María está decidida a dar lo mejor de sí  para seguir  adelante con su  pequeño taller  de calzados. Poniendo en práctica su proyecto   contrató  a 3  trabajadores quienes le apoyan en la  fabricación de sus  hermosos calzados mientras ella se encarga de la distribución al por mayor.Sus inmensos deseos de progreso, la gran cantidad de clientes y el enorme número hacen necesario su solicitud de un préstamo.  “Tu aporte desinteresado  será una buena  inversión en las manos de esta  luchadora madre”.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1050</funded_amount><paid_amount>1050</paid_amount><image><id>128034</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe

This family lives in the Sabana Grande area, located near the city&apos;s outskirts. This rural region has a temperate climate and semi dry soil. There is no drinking water or paved roads. The majority of its inhabitants earn a living selling fruits, vegetables, grains and meat, among other things.  This family leads a very humble life and at the moment has just enough to cover their day to day necessities.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;For the past 12 years, Magda and her husband have been earning a living fattening up pigs and selling the meat out of their small home. Their children help them with the housework and also on the business.  Magda starts her day at 5:00 AM to set everything up. She does this every day of the week, never taking a day off since she sells the most meat in the mornings. She sells meat retail and wholesale although sometimes she also sells the pigs.  Her main clients are homemakers and women who resale meat at the markets. This business is this family&apos;s only source of income. Magda needs the loan to buy 6 pigs of 150 Lbs each. She slaughters 2 to 3 pigs per week and currently only has 2 left.  This is not enough to meet the amount of meat that she sells daily.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Libertad Leal, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Doña Magda tiene 38 años de edad, esta casada, tiene 3 hijos, todos se encuentran estudiando en secundaria, esta familia habita en la comarca Sabana Grande, ubicada en las afueras de la Ciudad, es zona rural, clima fresco, las calles principales o avenidas no están pavimentadas, no tienen agua potable, es semi-árido, la mayoría de los pobladores se dedican al comercio informal de venta de frutas, granos básicos, legumbres, carne entre otras cosas.

La señora inicia su jornada de trabajo a las 5: 00 a.m. para preparar su negocio, todos los días de la semana sin descanso, ya que la mejor venta de carne es por la mañana, ella vende carne al detalle y por mayor y también vende los cerdos, las clientas de la señora son en su mayoría las amas de casa y las señoras que comercializan carne en los diferentes mercados. Es con este negocio como esta familia subsiste. La señora necesita un préstamo para comprar 6 cerdos de 150 libras, ya que por semana ella destaza de 2 a 3 cerdos y en estos momentos en existencia solo tiene 2, lo cual es insuficiente para la demanda de carne que vende por día.&lt;p&gt;</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>128035</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

She has been selling cosmetics, apparel, perfume, and shoes for men, women, and children for 23 years. She started her small business selling only cosmetics, but ultimately was able to expand her business, offering a new line of products. Her customers are primarily people who work and who order products for personal use. She sells her items from home, and on weekends, she travels to the city of Rivas to sell her merchandise in the markets and plazas there. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;This single mother has been able to help her only child, who is now studying, get ahead in life. She decided to build an extra room that she can rent in the front of her home as an additional source of income, thus allowing her to travel less to the inland region. This means she no longer has to leave her child under the care of relatives. With this extra income, she will be able to both cover the household expenses and pay for her child’s education. At this time, she still needs to build a wall and a roof, as well as paint the additional room. With this room, she will be able to pay for all the everyday expenditures that she must tackle on her own.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;La señora Esperanza es una microempresaria que posee  una vasta experiencia en las ventas al menudeo, hace 23 años se dedica a vender cosméticos, ropa, zapatos, perfumes para damas, caballeros y niños. Inició su pequeño negocio vendiendo únicamente cosméticos y fue con el tiempo que se fue expandiendo hasta ofrecer nuevas líneas de  productos como hasta ahora ofrece, sus clientas son mayormente personas que trabajan y que le encargan productos para uso personal. Es en su casa de habitación que ofrece sus productos y los fines de semana visita el departamento de Rivas a vender su mercadería en los mercados y plazas de esa ciudad. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Es con su negocio como ha sacado adelante esta madre soltera a su único hijo quien se encuentra estudiando. La señora como otra fuente de ingresos que le permita afrontar los gastos y viajar menos al interior del país dejando a su hijo con parientes que lo cuiden decidió construir un cuarto en la parte delantera de su vivienda para alquilarlo y así poder complementar los gastos básicos de la casa y la educación de su hijo, en estos momentos al cuarto le falta levantarle una pared, cerrar el techo y pintar el cuarto, con esto ella se ayudaría a suplir todos los gastos que ella sola afronta</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>128039</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Purchase

have a big restaurant.  In reality,  she takes care of everything in her restaurant.  It is ample sized location where ceviche and other seafood dishes is served for lunch, and typical Peruvian dishes at night.  Claudia is filled with joy at the site of what she has achieved up until now, but she still feels there is much to be done.  In spite of the hard work she has already put forth, it seems as though it has filled her with more ambition.  To date, she is looking to amplify her location and buy new furniture (tables, chairs, shelves, etc)&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from Spanish by James Lombardo, Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&#13;&#10;El sueño de Claudia de tener un gran restaurante se fue cumpliendo desde que un día, contando tan solo con una pequeña mesa, se dispuso a vender ceviche fuera de su casa.&#13;&#10;En la actualidad, ella maneja todo un restaurante. Un amplio local donde vende ceviche y platos marinos en el almuerzo y platos tipicos peruanos por la noche.&#13;&#10;Claudia se llena de felicidad al ver lo que ha logrado hasta ahora, pero aún siente que tiene mucho por hacer. Y por el contrario, los cuatros años de continuo esfuerzo parecen haberla llenado de más fuerza. &#13;&#10;Hoy en dia, ella está en busca de ampliar su local y comprar nuevos muebles (mesas sillas, estantes, etc).</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>128075</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase

Before moving to her current home she sold ceviche at another place located in the northern part of the city. She saw a better business opportunity in this current location, which is why she moved four years ago. She had to start over again with nothing, but she came anyway because she thought it would be better. And so it has. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Shortly after opening her small restaurant, people started to come, every time more than before. Although now she enjoys a good clientele, she is still not satisfied with what she has achieved. Her goal is to expand her restaurant, putting in place a better infrastructure so she can make more earnings. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In this way, with the help of her four children, she would begin to collect the necessary supplies to start construction of her dream — installing a textile shop to make clothes to sell at wholesale in the future.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by a Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;El negocio de la venta de ceviches Dominica lo tiene desde doce años atrás. Antes de mudarse a su actual vivienda ella vendía ceviches en otro lugar ubicado más al norte de la ciudad. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Al ver una mejor oportunidad del negocio en el distrito donde vive ahora, se mudo hace cuatro años. Tendría que volver a empezar de cero. No obstante, ella pensó que le iría mejor. Y así fue. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Al poco tiempo de inaugurar su pequeño restaurante la gente empezó a llegar cada vez más. Aunque ella ahora goza de una buena clientela, aún no se siente satisfecha con lo logrado. Su objetivo es ampliar  el local, construir una mejor infraestructura y obtener una ganacia mayor de ello.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;De este modo, y con la ayuda de sus cuatro hijos, empezaria a recaudar lo necesario para empezar a construir su sueño de instalar un taller textil para producir ropa y venderla al por mayor en el futuro.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>128081</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

She had sold clothing at the commercial center since 1999, and two years ago was when she started her own clothing store. The strides Adela has made have been admirable, and to think her business has grown through the work of only one hard-working and enterprising woman. But she does not consume herself with her store all day; she also makes sure that her three young daughters are never in need of anything. What would help her financially would be adding more items to sell and remodeling her store, for which she is requesting a $1,000 loan.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;A causa del desalojo que Adela sufrió con su puesto ambulante en un centro comercial, decidio abrir una tienda en su casa.&#13;&#10;Desde el año 1999 ella vendia ropa en aquel centro comercial y hace dos años lo hace en su propia tienda.&#13;&#10;Es admirable ver las ganas que Adela pone en su trabajo. Y ver cuánto ha crecido solo hace pensar que es una mujer emprendedora y muy trabajadora.&#13;&#10;A ella no le importa ocuparse todo el dia en su tienda  con tal  de ver que a sus hijas tres menores hijas no le falten nada.&#13;&#10;Lo que mejor podria hacer de obtener un financiamiento es implementar su tienda con más productos y mejores inmuebles, para ello necesita

She is 32 years old, married and has 2 children. Together with her brother (see picture), she has purchased a little truck and began selling fruits and vegetables. Each morning she travels to nearby villages with her husband purchasing goods, brings them to the city, rents a spot on the market and sells the produce at a price that is about 20-25% higher than the purchase price was. Because her start up capital is very small, she is unable to increase the profit from her business, which makes it difficult to provide for her family. This is why she came to &quot;Normicro&quot; - a partner of Kiva - asking to borrow $600. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Кемфля, жительница пригорода Саатлы Республики Азербайджан, расположенного в Закавказском регионе, проживает в крестьянской семье. Ей 32 года, замужем , имеет двоих детей. В месте со своим братом (см. фото), купив небольшой грузовичок, она начала приторговывать фруктами и овощами. Каждое утро она со своим мужем ездит по деревням, закупая товар с огородов, привозит их в город, и арендуя на местном рынке место, продаёт купленный товар, накладывая на него приблизительно 20-25% от закупленной стоимости. Имея малую сумму капитала в бизнесе, она не может увеличить прибыль, чтобы обеспечить многодетную семью. Поэтому она обратилась в местный филиал микро кредитной организации &quot;Нормикро&quot; - партнёра КИВА - с заявлением о предоставлении ей кредита суммой в 600 долларов.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>128153</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits

The income from this business is not enough to cover all the family and business expenditures. Usubali purchases calves, breeds them, and sells them to the butcher, who works in the local market. To increase his profit margin, Usubali has to invest some money to make his small herd bigger. His application to Normicro Saatli branch for a $500 loan is approved already.

She is 55, married, with five children, and lives in the village of Saatli town in the south-central flat area of Azerbaijan Republic in Caucasus region.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Amina owns a herd of milk cows. Every day she sells milk to the local milk-processing shop. Her children help her breed cows in the nearby grazing field. The income from her four cows is too low to support the family or to increase her number of cows. That’s why Amina has applied to Norwegian Microcredit Saatli branch for $600 loan, to buy one more pure-bred cow to make her monthly income higher. The price of a milk calf is $300, and the cost of breeding is $100. The other $100 she plans to save for unexpected expenditures.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>128161</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Dairy</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Everyday she gains around $3 a day of profit from her sales. To supplement her standard of living, her husband Mr. Sim Sopheap, 39, works as a taxi-driver making on average $5 a day of profit. This couple has two childR. who are students. They strongly believe that their business would improve if they have a loan from Kiva org. &lt;p&gt;To improve their businesses and to make them successful, this couple categorizes the loan into 2 parts. First, they want to use this loan to purchase more groceries and sell them in large amounts. Second, they need to expand the business. With the principal’s plan they hope that their business will reach the target and gain more profit. &lt;p&gt;They will use the profit to send their child to a university. In conclusion, Sun and her family are grateful and appreciative for your trust and

T., 27, is married with three children and is a housewife who stays at home to look after the children and cook food for her family. To supplement their living condition, her husband Mr. Ngov Leang Nghy, 36, works as a motor-taxi driver and he normally makes on average around $4 a day of profit. This couple hopes to use this loan to purchase a new motor-bike for their son to use as a motor-taxi driver to sustain the standard of living. When the business goes forward and it provides more benefits, this couple will use the money to run another business by opening a grocery stand. Moreover, Mrs. Chanthu will bring all her children to school. Finally, this couple would like to thank for all lenders who contribute the capital to make their business grow.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>650</funded_amount><paid_amount>650</paid_amount><image><id>128180</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Taxi</activity><sector>Transportation</sector><use>Neth

I have four kids: two girls and two boys. I am a textile designer and create embroidered clothes. My husband is a daily wage laborer. My eldest son now also works transporting goods on a donkey cart. My son would like to buy an additional donkey cart for his business. He feels that his income would double, and we would be able to repair our house. &lt;p&gt;This is a group loan, and the women in it have been together for more than one year. Waloo M.’s husband runs a small restaurant. Sajida B. and Jindo M. would use their loans to buy bull carts. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;We all are mutually responsible for this loan; if one defaults, the others make up the

My boutique does well, and with the profits I bought a television for my house. I would use this  loan to expand my boutique and produce a greater variety of embroidered clothes. This is a group loan. Shahnaz B. would use the loan to expland her husband&apos;s vegetable business.  Faizan M. wants to buy a cow.  Mukhtar B. sells milk from her house.

Mr. Luciano works as a driver of a small truck transporting construction supplies.  His wife works doing wash at individual homes.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With previous loans they were able to build approximately half of a perimeter wall, as well as two bedrooms.  The credit they are currently seeking would be to finish the perimeter wall, and to demolish a bedroom made from adobe that is very old and deteriorated.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This will be his eighth loan, and the socioeconomic analysis completed indicates he qualifies favorably for access to credit.  Luciano has been a client of ours since the year 2000 and has always paid back his loans satisfactorily.&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;El señor Luciano C. vive en casa propia en la zona de Alpacoma de la Ciudad de La Paz con su esposa, la señora Maria Capcha y sus tres hijos. El señor Luciano trabaja como chofer de una volqueta realizando el traslado de material de construcción y su esposa realiza el trabajo de lavandería en casas particulares.&#13;&#10;Con anteriores créditos realizaron la construcción de muro perimetral en un 50% y la conclusión de dos habitaciones en planta alta.&#13;&#10;El crédito solicitado será destinado a la construcción de la totalidad del muro perimetral y la demolición de una habitación de adobe que por su antigüedad se encuentra en total deterioro.&#13;&#10;Esta es la octava ocasión que solicita un préstamo y el análisis socioeconómico realizado los califica favorablemente y puede acceder  a un  crédito.

She promotes cosmetic products and her husband works in a sporting goods store.&lt;p&gt;  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The rooms they occupy date back more than twenty years and the roof, due to age-related deterioration, is in disrepair and leaks when it rains.&lt;p&gt;  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The credit solicited would be earmarked to replace a roof and remodel the interior of one bedroom.  This is the first occasion they seek a loan and the socioeconomic analysis completed indicates they qualify favorably for access to credit.  &lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora Karen R. vive en casa de sus padres en la zona de Llojeta ladera oeste de la Ciudad de La Paz con su esposo, el señor Edson España y sus dos hijos. La señora Karen es promotora de productos cosméticos y su esposo es empleado en una tienda de venta de artículos deportivos.&#13;&#10;Las habitaciones que ocupan datan de más de veinte años y los techos, debido al deterioro por su antigüedad presentan fisuras que se traducen en filtraciones de agua cuando llueve.&#13;&#10;El crédito solicitado será destinado al cambio de techos en una habitación y la reparación del revoque interior de la habitación.&#13;&#10;Esta es la primera ocasión que solicita un préstamo y el análisis socioeconómico realizado los califica favorablemente y puede acceder  a un  crédito.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>128356</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cosmetics

She runs a neighborhood store out of her home, and her husband works as a driver of a small truck transporting construction supplies. &lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The rooms they occupy are rented and their plot of land still has a foundation for an additional room.  Their loan would be earmarked to building two rooms so they can move to a place of their own.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is the third occasion that she seeks a loan, and the socioeconomic analysis conducted indicates they qualify favorably for access to credit.  This will be the second time that Griselda solicits credit through Kiva.  Her prior loan was paid in its entirety and without any delays.&lt;p&gt;      &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora Griselda C. vive en casa propia en la zona de Alpacoma ladera oeste de la Ciudad de La Paz con su esposo, el señor Francisco Cacasaca y sus dos hijos.

Asenciona has been a member for five years, while Martha and Maura joined one year ago. In their community bank, they have learned to be responsible, punctual, learned how to invest in their businesses, and to save.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Asenciona is 55 years old.  She is married and has nine children, two of whom live with her. Asenciona sells food staples, such as flour, rice and sugar.  In addition, she sells fruits and vegetables from her home. With the help of her children, Asenciona has been working in this area for several years.&lt;/P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Martha is 58 years old. She is married and has six children, only one of whom is still living with her. Martha and her daughter sell clothing to friends and family. They bring the clothes from the cities of Lima and Tacna. In addition, Martha owns a motorcycle taxi that she rents to her son.&lt;/P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Maura is 33 years old. She is married and has three children. For the past six months, Maura has been selling food at the main bus stop in Ayacucho.  In addition, Maura travels to the jungle region once every two weeks, where she buys fish and vegetables to resell in Ayacucho.&lt;/P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Asenciona, Martha, and Maura need loans of 400, 400, and 600 soles respectively (3 soles = $1), which they will use to buy milk, oil, sugar, rice, fruit, fish, and vegetables.&lt;/P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;One of the important aspects of the community bank is the interest-earnings savings account that each associate has. Asenciona, Martha, and Maura plan to use their savings to pay for their children’s education and to increase the capital available to their businesses. Their dreams are to own their own home, buy a motorcycle taxi, and that their children will be professionals.&lt;/P&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>128364</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food
