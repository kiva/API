The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as &lt;i&gt;boleo&lt;/i&gt; in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water from the nearby river.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>825</funded_amount><paid_amount>825</paid_amount><image><id>35863</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Farm rice</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Santa Lucia</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-2.183333 -80</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-16T22:59:22Z</posted_date><loan_amount>825</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maximo</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-01T22:16:09Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>825</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>825</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>66</amount><local_amount>66</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-09T17:25:58Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-11T22:50:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21965</payment_id><comment>1er pago asociacion 1 de agosto de sta lucia</comment></payment><payment><amount>66</amount><local_amount>66</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-05T20:25:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-11T22:50:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>29292</payment_id><comment>2do pago 1 de agosto</comment></payment><payment><amount>66</amount><local_amount>66</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-08T22:11:42Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-11T22:50:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>40399</payment_id><comment>3er pago 1 de agosto</comment></payment><payment><amount>66</amount><local_amount>66</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-10T20:21:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-11T22:50:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>65661</payment_id><comment>4to pago 1 de agosto</comment></payment><payment><amount>561</amount><local_amount>561</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-11T22:50:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-11T22:50:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>561</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>66077</payment_id><comment>5to pago 1 de agosto</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-18T22:16:09Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-11T22:50:45Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10118</id><name>Felipe</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;  Felipe has a small piece of land that he inherited from his father.

It is a big happiness for his family because while they had one son already, they could not have more children for 20 years. The doctors had to deliver the baby by cesarean section to keep her alive. To have enough milk for the little girl, Ismatullo purchased a dairy cow. Now Ismatullo has a plan to reconstruct his house and extend the space for his household. His request for a loan is to purchase hogs and sheep. Ismatullo has been working for 23 years at a music school. He teaches children to play the national instrument, the “doyra”. He likes his job but says that livestock is the business of his family. It is passed from one generation to another.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>35928</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Livestock</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Puchase

She is married with four children and her eldest daughter is in secondary school. Devota runs a tailoring business from the verandah of her home. The business has not been good recently due to insufficient sewing materials and competition she faces from her neighbors.

She runs a retail shop near her residence selling different consumable items, food in particular. Since she started this shop three years ago, she noticed only minimal improvements until she attended “Business and Entrepreneurship Training”, from YOSEFO. She is very delighted with the recent improvements. What draws her back is lack of enough working capital. Due to her weak capital base she is likely to lose some customers as she is usually faced with being out of stock. To sustain her stock level she is in need of $550 to strengthen her working capital. The amount will be used to add stock of some items, especially those with high turnover.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>35945</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Monicah did a course in pharmacy but due to the recent competition in that field, she was unable to secure a job. She was so stressed out that her mother, having sufficient experience in poultry farming, advised her on starting the same business. &lt;P&gt;Monicah did quite well and her business really picked up. She however does not have enough money to expand the business and now she is requesting a loan of US$ 600. She will use US$ 300 to buy more poultry, US$120 to prepare a place to keep the chickens, and US$ 180 to buy poultry feed. She is certain that this will work well for her.</en></texts></description><status>deleted</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><image><id>35951</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Poultry</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>purchase poultry and poultry feed</use><location><country_code>KE</country_code><country>Kenya</country><town>wanyororo</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>1 38</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>25</partner_id><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Monicah</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_amount>600</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments/><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10166</id><name>Ezinah</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Ezinah I. is a 58-year-old nurse who lives with her husband and their four children in Kisumu, Kenya.

In 2005, she opened her own clinic (Mt Everest Medical Clinic) in Manyatta, one of the most densely populated slums of Kisumu.  In her clinic she offers general curative services, family planning, counseling, and maternal and child health care services, and also has integrated a pharmacy and laboratory within the clinic. She, in collaboration with K-MET, sells safe motherhood vouchers to expecting poor mothers, which enables them to access reproduction health services in certain medical facilities. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ezinah attributes her success to hard work, perseverance, and assistance from K-MET’s microfinance loan.  She has been able to renovate her facility, purchase a stock of drugs, and improve the quality of care she provides.

This group has already taken and repaid one Kiva loan – you can check out their previous journal entries and more photos of the group members at http://www.kiva.org/app.php?page=businesses&amp;action=about&amp;id=154.  In this loan application, the group described their business as follows:&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Objectives: To make it possible for the women to remain on their land by giving them the chance to earn substantial income in order to meet their basic living needs.&#13;&#10;Activities: Harvesting and sale of local incense [note: this incense is made from the roots of the grass that grows in the Senegal River and is popular in markets throughout Senegal], in addition to small-scale retail sale of local products.  [The incense-selling business] will consist of harvesting the incense roots where they grow and then processing them into incense which will be sold in the local market and in the other markets of Senegal.” &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Original French business description:&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;«Objectifs :&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;-&#9;Fixer les femmes dans leur terroir&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;-&#9;Leurs permettrent d’avoir des revenus substantiels pour la prise en charge de leurs besoins prioritaires ;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Activités :&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Exploitation de l’encens au niveau local&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Petit commerce&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Il s’agit  de chercher la matière première sur place  et ensuite le traiter avant de le vendre dans le marché local comme dans les autres localité du Pays.»&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Background&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Senegal is one of the world’s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal’s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>975</funded_amount><paid_amount>975</paid_amount><image><id>36012</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Crafts</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Homemade

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Objectives: To make it possible for the women to remain on their land by giving them the chance to earn substantial income in order to meet their basic living needs.&#13;&#10;Activities: Harvesting and sale of local incense [note: this incense is made from the roots of the grass that grows in the Senegal River and is popular in markets throughout Senegal], in addition to small-scale retail sale of local products.  [The incense-selling business] will consist of harvesting the incense roots where they grow and then processing them into incense which will be sold in the local market and in the other markets of Senegal.” &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Original French business description: &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;«Objectifs : &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;-&#9;Fixer les femmes dans leur terroir&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;-&#9;Leurs permettrent d’avoir des revenus substantiels pour la prise en charge de leurs besoins prioritaires ; &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Activités : &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Exploitation de l’encens au niveau local&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Petit commerce&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Il s’agit  de chercher la matière première sur place  et ensuite le traiter avant de le vendre dans le marché local comme dans les autres localité du Pays.» &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Background&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Senegal is one of the world’s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal’s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>975</funded_amount><paid_amount>975</paid_amount><image><id>36014</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Crafts</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Homemade

V. is 32 years old and lives with his wife and his child in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  He makes his living by operating a tuk tuk (a passenger taxi cart attached to a motor bike) and typically makes around $4/day. His wife (pictured here because V. is unavailable), meanwhile, runs a business at home selling duck eggs, roast beef, chickens, local wine, and other grocery products. She normally earns about $25/day in revenue. Their child attends school and usually helps to sell at home when she finishes class. In order to help finance his household, Tey has asked for a loan to purchase another tuk tuk such that he may generate more income.&#13;&#10;Additionally, Tey and his wife are eager to one day expand the amount of grocery items sold at their stand.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>36052</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Vehicle

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mark A. is 30 years old, single, and lives with two dependants, a boy and a girl, who are members of his extended family. One of the dependant’s parents died due to HIVAIDS and the other was abandoned during the 1992 land clashes in the Transmara region of Kenya. He lives with them within Kayole, Kenya.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2004 Mark ventured into the business sector by doing tailoring and dressmaking, which he did for 3 years. The business capital was provided by Kenya Agency of Development and Entrepreneurial Technology (KADET), a World Vision micro-finance wing. A loan of Ksh 56,000.00 (USD 800) enabled him to buy sewing machines and clothing materials and he was later able to settle the loan. A golden opportunity from the World Vision emerged and got him a tender to make school uniforms for four schools within Kayole. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2005, as a form of business expansion, Mark started a mobile phone repair shop and sale of mobile phone accessories. He employed 3 orphans who had gone through technical skills training sponsored by World Vision. Besides offering mobile phone charging services, the number of clients seeking phone repairs has greatly increased. He is currently not able to serve his customers effectively since he lacks computers and power flashers that enable detection of a problem in the phone software hence he incurs extra costs in having to seek that kind of service in the city centre, 20 kilometers from his business location. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mark is requesting for a loan of (USD 650) to enable him purchase a computer and power flashers. This will enable him to detect the problem in the phone software and to do repairs. This will help improve the profit margins by cutting down on costs of transportation and consultation services from other dealers and also bring flashing services closer to other technicians operating within Kayole. The business will also create employment for the people of Kayole. The loan is repayable within 12 – 18 months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>650</funded_amount><paid_amount>650</paid_amount><image><id>36057</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Phone

She operates a hair salon business in a town suburb. She has been in this business for six years.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ann, a professional teacher, managed to start the salon business with money she saved. The extra income has helped to improve the standard of living of the family.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Anne&apos;s salon is located near Makerere University and has a high number of student clients. Private entrepreneurs have opened up hostels to accommodate the increasing number of students at the university.

Vive en la zona de Villa San Antonio Alto de la ciudad de La Paz, donde también es su taller, su trabajo lo realiza a pedido, y sus mayores ingresos son por arreglo de todo tipo de muebles&#13;&#10;Su historial en nuestra institución la califica como cliente 2, es decir con cumplimiento regular  en el pago de su obligación. El monto solicitado será destinado para la compra de materia prima (Madera, Venesta, clavos, lijas y pegamento).&#13;&#10;Su trabajo y antecedentes crediticios con Impro le permiten acceder a este crédito ya que tiene experiencia en su negocio.

Vladimir works as a security guard for a customs company at El Alto International Airport. With prior loans, he&apos;s been able to add four rooms to his home. But the main wall facing the street is deteriorating and dangerous, and it can let in water when it is raining. The loan Vladimir is requesting would be used to replace the current adobe and construct a wall of brick and mortar.

Nurhayati and her husband, Amad, buy waste material like plastic cups, plastic bottles, cardboard, and paper from her neighbors and other houses in the village. Her husband uses a cart to collect scrap metal and other waste material. Households do not just give away waste material, because there is demand and therefore economic value in recycling. So the more working capital they have, the more scrap they can collect and recycle. Their own working capital is limited. Having heard from her friends about MBK, Nurhayati has now applied to MBK to add to her working capital. Since this is the first time Nurhayati can only borrow a maximum of $500 from MBK. Every three days, Nurhayati sells the waste materials to intermediate dealer and she can earn profit of $5.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>50</funded_amount><paid_amount>50</paid_amount><image><id>36310</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Services</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To

She recently retired from one job, however she was forced to continue working in order to support herself. Eight years ago she decided to start her own business so she could be self-sustainable. By concentrating on a fairly narrow market niche to avoid a head-on collision with bigger competitors, Valentina has developed a successful business selling lightweight bathrobes, pajamas and slippers in the local market. Her inventory is characterized by the finest fabrics, warmth and comfort which attracts many customers to her kiosk.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Valentina trusts the Lord with her venture. She prays often about it and is very committed to its success. Presently, she has about $1,000 in inventory. Her gross revenue is about $1,300 per month and her net profit amounts to around $320 a month.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Valentina has requested a loan for $800 to re-stock her inventory. She would like purchase a good supply of simple, elegant bathrobes and an assortment of slippers that come in a variety of colors and are one-size-fits-all. She is confident that they will sell well and bring her additional income.

He faces difficulties in taking care of his family, especially the wife who gave birth through surgical operation for all three children. His father died when he was only a child, and there was nobody to support him through secondary education. Motivated by these setbacks, he became a member of GHAPE and benefited from his first loan of $30 in 1998. Throughout the period of 1998 to April 2007, he has proven his ability to receive, invest, and repay loans up to $400. With these loans, he has assisted the community with good piglets, manure, and food crops.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of $1000, he plans to buy a motorcycle and the official documents. Since the roads are not in good condition, many transport vehicles hardly go through the road, and motorcycles are the only alternatives to transport people and luggage.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;He plans to pay his loan in 24 months. The first loan repayment installment shall be made on the fourth month from the date of disbursement of the loan.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>36475</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Motorcycle

Realizing the heavy needs from her six children, some of which are currently attending school, and the fact that she receives no support from her husband, she was motivated to take the first loan of $30 from GHAPE, which she invested in vegetable cultivation.  Her immediate goal is to raise money for tuition for her children’s education.

Alice</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Born in 1965, Alice is a mother of three children. She faced difficulties with her mother-in-law and the death of her father when she was still young. To her, it was a dream come true when GHAPE extended outreach into her community and the problem of inadequate capital disappeared as she received her first loan in 2005. With her previous loans, she provided her community with pork, manure, and yams. Her goal is to build her self-esteem and provide for her children.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of $400, she plans to reinforce her pig fence and buy piglets, pig feed, and medication. She plans to repay her loans from farming activities with manure from her pig farm and to make savings in her pigs. She is convinced that her business will succeed because of her skills in the domain, the available market, and the support from her group and center members.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She plans to pay her loan in 18 months. The first installment repayment shall be on the fourth month from the date of disbursement of the loan.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>36498</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>production

His recognition of the poor living condition of his family (seen in poor feeding habits, housing, clothing, constant sickness, and inability to pay school fees) is strength and a source of motivation for him to engage in income-generating activities in pig farming. The success registered so far is due the availability of local feeding materials. He is a third-time borrower. With his two previous loans, he succeeded in providing the community with manure and fresh raw foodstuffs. Benefits from his investment were primarily used for tuition. He succeeded in reducing the number of times his children were sent out of class for fee-drive. His immediate goal is to provide the basics of food, tuition, and clothing to his family.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of $400, he plans to buy ten piglets, feed, and medication and set aside some money for vet services for pigs. He plans to provide his community with large quantities of manure. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;He plans to pay his loan in 18 months. The first installment repayment shall be on the fourth month from the date of disbursement of the loan.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>36501</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>production

Rose</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>42-year-old Rose is a widow and a mother of seven children. After the death of her husband, she was left alone to take care of all seven children. Rose has been a long-time pig farmer and has attended a good number of training sessions on pig farming and poultry. Her previous loans from GHAPE were invested in agriculture and the profit she got from the activity was used to pay her children’s school fees, and part equally went to pay for one of them who is learning a trade. The manure she gets from her poultry and pig farm is used for crop cultivation, and the surplus is sold to other members of the community, thereby increasing food production. Due to increased demand from the local public, there is need for her to increase her production. &#13;&#10;With a loan of $600, Rose wants to buy 4 more piglets, 50 week-old chicks, 20 bags of pig and fowl feed, and equally cultivate more land.&#13;&#10;She plans to repay the loan in 18 months. The first installment of repayment shall be made on the fourth month from the date of loan disbursement.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>36505</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Animal

Anwi</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>T. Perpetual was born on January 2nd, 1968, and is a mother of two boys and a girl. She was coerced into getting married by her parents and, since then, her marital home has been a living hell. Her husband doesn’t take care of her or the children, and she has been a victim of domestic violence. Facing difficulties in raising business capital in order to take care of her children, she found her way to GHAPE in 2005 and benefited from her first loan disbursement of $40, which was used in retailing foodstuffs and groceries in the quarter. From her, members of the community could get most of their basic needs without necessarily waiting for the market day, thereby reducing inconveniences and distance. The profit she got from the business was used to pay for her children’s education. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With $400, she plans to buy beans, rice, and groundnuts in bags and milk, tin tomatoes, and sugar in cartons in order to meet the demand of the community at all times.     &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She plans to repay the loan in 18 months. The first installment of loan repayment shall be done on the fourth month from the date of loan disbursement.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>36506</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

All six children are currently attending school, and she has been facing a lot of difficulties coping with their requirements. Being unable to raise business capital in order to support her husband in the education of her children, she was motivated to receive her first loan from GHAPE in 2004. &#13;&#10;From her previous loans, she has been providing her community with raw foodstuffs and manure from her pig farm and assisting her husband in the payment of school fees for all six children. &#13;&#10;With a loan of $400, she plans to buy two more piglets and rice, beans, and groundnuts in bulk. She thinks that her business will succeed because of high demand for foodstuffs and equally because she sells at a moderate price in order to have a quick turnover.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She

She also travels to buy jackets and coats in Desaguadero (Peru) in order to have imported ones, as well, in her shop. She receives contracts from businesses or individuals to make the jackets or coats. She also increases her business by making exercise clothes and doing all sorts of sewing jobs. She doesn’t have permanent employees, but she creates jobs indirectly since it is her son who cuts the fabric and sends it to the homes of tailors so they can finish the process of assembling the clothing; she pays them for the finished work. She lives in the Tembladerani zone of the city of La Paz, which is also where she also has her shop. She has a place in the Eguino Plaza, in La Paz, where she sells her products individually or by the dozen. Elena has been a client of IMPRO since May 1998. Her history with our institution qualifies her as “Client 1”, which means she has earned the level “Good” in the repayment of her obligation. The amount requested will be used to buy materials (fabrics, zippers, thread, and decorations for the jackets and coats). Her job and credit history with IMPRO allow her to obtain this loan, since she has experience in her business, the income from which will cover the loan.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;Elena tiene un taller de costura donde elabora chamarras y parcas de varón. También viaja a comprar chamarras y parcas a Desaguadero (Perú) para dotar a su puesto con chamarras importadas. Recibe contratos de empresas o personas particulares para la elaboración de chamarras o parcas, además que amplia su negocio realizando buzos deportivos y todo referente a costura; no tiene empleados fijos, pero genera trabajo indirecto ya que es su hijo quien efectúa el corte de las prendas  y envía a domicilio a costureros para que puedan terminar las prendas en proceso de confección cancelándoles por trabajo terminado.&#13;&#10;Vive en la zona de Tembladerani de la ciudad de La Paz, donde también está su taller, y  tiene un puesto de venta  en la Plaza Eguino de la misma Ciudad  donde vende su producto por unidad y docena.&#13;&#10;Es cliente de Impro desde Mayo de 1998 Su historial en nuestra institución la califica como cliente 1, es decir con cumplimiento Bueno en el pago de su obligación. El monto solicitado será destinado para la compra de materia prima (Tela, forro, cierre, hilo y adornos  para la elaboración de chamarras y parcas)&#13;&#10;Su trabajo y antecedentes crediticios con Impro le permiten acceder a este crédito ya que tiene experiencia en su negocio el cual le da ingresos para cubrir el préstamo.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>36681</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Seven years ago she started selling her products to her neighbors and little by little her business grew, until today she has an employee helping her with the business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Claudia is requesting a loan in the amount of $475 to buy a cooler to keep her products fresh. They are made basically of dairy products, and because of the heat in this region they go bad quickly. The temperature in this place fluctuates between 38 and 42 degrees centigrade. Claudia offers to pay off this loan over a period of 6 to 12 months. She and her family thank you for your support and they await your help in order to improve their quality of life.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(Translated from the Spanish by Naomi Johnson, Kiva

repostería, así hace siete años atrás empezó vendiendo sus productos entre sus vecinos y poco a poco fue creciendo en su negocio, que a la fecha tiene una persona que la ayuda con el negocio.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Claudia está solicitando un préstamo por la cantidad de US $ 475 para la compra de un enfriador y así poder mantener sus productos frescos, los cuales son

For that reason, when she couldn&apos;t find work, she decided to open, in her own home, a little place to rent computers with access to the internet.

So 15 years ago Maria Feliciana decided to work to help her husband with the household expenses, and above all the education of her children. She started selling tamales and other food, along with shoes. She had to travel to another city where she could buy good quality shoes cheaply, along with curtains and blankets, and in this way offer good prices to her customers. Little by little she got ahead. Today her children are married, but Maria Feliciana has not lost the taste for work, and she now dedicates herself to the sale of health products.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maria Feliciana is requesting a loan for $375 to buy a new product put out by the company that supplies her health products.

At this time, Oishahon goes over to selling greens. Her daughters help her. &lt;P&gt;She spent the first loan she received ($ 300) to buy vegetables for sale.

She goes to buy goods to the market at Kokand, Uzbekistan, 55 km away from her house. She has no problem crossing the border, and goods are cheaper there.  She has been receiving loans from MicroInvest already for half a year. She uses the loan for replenishment of her goods. &lt;P&gt;The winter has ended now but Mukaddas still has winter clothes among her goods, which she plans to sell next season. Therefore she needs additional capital to purchase a spring-summer assortment. Also the new loan of $800 will be used for improvement of her work place

His father instilled love of animals in all his children and nowadays they are all in business with livestock raising and fattening. Together with his elder brother, Sultan would go to all the neighboring markets to buy bulls and cows. &lt;P&gt;A year ago Sulton got his first loan of $300. Having added his own money, he bought 12 young bulls of the same breed for himself from neighboring Kyrgystan.  As it turned out, the bulls were of tribal breed, so after 4 months of their sale, it turned out that Sulton had doubled the money he had received. From that time on, he constantly buys and raises  this breed. All his family is engaged in his business. Sulton&apos;s son already knows all the details of this business and helps his father. &lt;P&gt;Now Sulton is planning to modernize and expand the place he keeps his animals. He needs $ 1200 to do this. Sulton will add his savings and prepare the place, as he intends to expand his business even

He works alone and when he has too many orders, he hires extra tailors to help him and he pays them for each finished suit. He designs and creates each suit individually because each one is hand-made, custom fit and to the customer&apos;s liking. Freddy also alters men&apos;s and women&apos;s clothes. It is his first time applying for a loan and the money will be used to buy basic material (fabric, zippers, threads, buttons.) His work and the conditions of his workshop qualifies him to apply for a loan, because he has experience in his business and a good amount of clients, which means he can generate enough income to repay the loan.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Translated from Spanish by Isabel Tan, a Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Freddy tiene un taller de sastrería en la Zona 14 de Septiembre de la ciudad de La Paz, la cual es una zona muy comercial y adecuada a la actividad que tiene.

También realiza arreglos y composturas de trajes de mujer o varón.&#13;&#10;Es la primera vez que solicita crédito. El monto solicitado será destinado para la compra de materia prima (Tela, forro, cierre, hilo, botones)&#13;&#10;Su trabajo y las instalaciones de su taller le permiten acceder a este crédito ya que

She started as a school bus chauffer. Then, she managed a grocery store that was far from her home.  Noting that this required a lot of travel time, she decided to start a business in her home and saved money to do this start-up.  So far, she&apos;s been running the business from her home for 2 years and it is going very well.  She works every day from 6am to 11pm. Her husband helps a lot with the business as well.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ligia requires credit in order to enhance her business line with more products such as meats and sausages. She would like to buy an oven in order to start making breads as well. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ligia is married and has 3 children who are all studying. During their spare moments, they help with the store as well. Her husband is a chauffer and uses his own car to chauffer school children.  In addition to running her store, Ligia is studying baking in a course run by a company called Empresa.  She hopes to finish the course and then be able to start making fresh bread products to sell. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10; Ligia tiene una experiencia de 12 años con su actividad. Se inicio siendo chofer de expreso escolar. Pone un local de venta de víveres lejos de su domicilio. Viendo que esto le significaba demasiado tiempo decide con sus ahorros adecuar su hogar para poner su negocio en casa.  Actualmente tiene ya 2 años en su domicilio y le ha ido muy bien. Trabaja todos los días de la semana en horario de 6 a.m. hasta las 11 p.m. Su esposo le ayuda mucho en su negocio siendo una ayuda enorme para ella.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Ligia desea el crédito para poder surtir su negocio con otra clase de productos como lo son las carnes y embutidos. Además ella ya cuenta con un horno y muy pronto comenzara a producir panes. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Ligia es casada. Tiene 3 hijos los cuales estudian y en sus ratos libres le ayudan con la atención de la tienda. Su esposo trabaja de chofer en carro propio haciendo expreso escolar. Ligia además de su trabajo ella también estudia panadería en nuestros cursos que da la Empresa. Su deseo es poder terminar su curso y de esta manera con el conocimiento comenzar a trabajar en la elaboración de productos de panadería. &lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>36818</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Market</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Augment her business with new products</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Guayaquil</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-2.166667 -79.9</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-22T16:02:06Z</posted_date><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ligia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-05T18:25:01Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>600</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-05T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-05T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-22T09:15:14Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-22T10:15:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>25286</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-22T09:15:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-22T10:15:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>34212</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-22T09:15:21Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-22T10:15:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>45109</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-22T09:15:16Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-22T10:15:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>57164</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-22T09:15:15Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-22T10:15:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>70403</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-22T10:15:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-22T10:15:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>84705</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-22T18:25:01Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-11-22T10:15:08Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10407</id><name>Verónica</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt; Veronica has 2 years of experience running her own business.

Although Don Miguel and his wife are older they refuse to be burdens to their children who do not make much money. They purchase certain fruits and vegetables at wholesale prices from his town and take them into the city to be sold. They also bring goods from the city back to Quevedo where they can resell them for a profit. He travels back and forth about twice a week and is happy with his business. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is Miguel&apos;s second loan with Kiva and Mifex. WIth the first loan he was able to invest in a variety of household items that he resold in his hometown. The initial investment allowed him to permanently increase his capital reserves so he could bring in more profits consistently as he was able to purchase more products as investments. He ended up investing in a small plot of oranges in his hometown. He is still waiting to cultivate the profits, but he is very optimistic about this particular investment. Miguel was also able to improve his home by building a bathroom with plumbing inside his home when previously he only had an outhouse. He plans to invest his second loan just as the first one, in household products to resell in his hometown. He wants to continue to improve his home with the profits, beginning by changing the walls which are currently made out of bamboo. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated by Chloé

Maria used to sell vegetables from her stand, but because profits were not sufficient she and her husband decided to try something different. After being forced to move from their old location because they did not have government permits, they moved the stand to a location closer to their home. Maria and her husband prepare the juice and fruit salad in the mornings. While Maria stays at the stand, her husband travels around the community in his tricycle cart selling the fresh juice and fruit salad.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is Maria&apos;s second loan with Kiva and Mifex. With her first loan she purchased new types of utensils and appliances. She purchased a new blender, sandwich maker and juicer. Although she had planned to invest in a new cart, when time came to make the investment she decided it was a wiser move to reinforce her current stand before venturing into a new point of sale. She is happy with the decision now that she can work much more efficiently and her client base has increased. Her second loan will be directed towards making the investment in a new cart as she planned before.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maria is 35 years old, married, and has 3 children. They live in her husband’s family&apos;s house where they pay rent. Maria’s goal is to save up enough money to buy herself and her children a home. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated by Chloé Tuot, a Kiva

He sells all types of food products from his shop, ranging from rice to snacks for kids. He started this business with $15 (which was worth much more in Ecuador 10 years ago) and only sold rice, sugar, oil and plantains. Although he was one of the first businesses in this area he now faces competition from other stores around him. In order to contest with these businesses Lorenzo is looking to increase and diversify his inventory with this loan. He wants to begin selling chicken, meat, sausages and eggs as well as any other products that may be in demand. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lorenzo has already lent from Kiva and Mifex and he did great with his first loan. He invested in a variety of products just as he planned. He saw his profits and the demand in the sector increase as his prices became the most competitive. He ended up investing in a second display refrigerator in order to keep the increased inventory fresh while also being able to show it to his customers. He made some small improvements to his home, although most of the profits went to the daily necessities of his wife and family.  He wants to continue to invest in products for his store as he continues to grow and provide services for the community. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated by Chloé Tuot, a

She was born in Pader, Kitgum. She left Kitgum due to political instability. When she came to Kampala, she settled at a camp for those who were internally displaced in Banda-Kireka. Life was not easy, and she had to look for means of survival. She entered the stone quarry business to earn sustenance for herself and the rest of the family. Her husband got a job with a security organization as a guard. Together, they has been able to increase their family&apos;s income.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In time she was introduced to the Life in Africa foundation. Since Sylvia knows other ladies involved in paper bead making, she found it very easy to learn how to make the beads. She is now a confident member, earning up to shsUG 150,000 per month from producing beads. She plans to build a family house at Pader where she can sleep when she visits her home district.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Sylvia&apos;s quarrying business involves paying labor for the digging of the stones, cracking them to the desired sizes, and then loading them to the customers&apos; trucks. She used to produce two truckloads but now hopes to make three more per month with the increased capital from the loan.

She took refuge in Kampala and eventually relocated to Acholi Quarter. While in Kampala, hard work is a part of her life. She started doing what she could to earn money for her family by selling sugar-canes and breaking stones. She eventually acquired her own pit and was able to earn more through dedication and hard work.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Paska&apos;s luck soon changed when she was introduced to Life in Africa. She joined and quickly started learning how to make paper beads. This brought a wonderful change in her life. She started earning more money, which was used to feed her family, pay for her school fees, and other necessities.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Paska dreams of constructing a permanent family house in the village. With peace on the horizon, people are starting to leave the camps and return home. Her family will need a house when they resettle back to Northern Uganda. For this she is requesting a loan in the amount of 150 USD. She will use the money to expand her quarry business so that she can start saving money to build her home. She will repay this loan in 6 months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>150</funded_amount><paid_amount>150</paid_amount><image><id>36974</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Quarrying</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>Hiring Laboures</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Banda-Kireka</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.266667 31.9</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>8</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-18T23:55:30Z</posted_date><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Paska</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-02T00:32:21Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>150</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-29T09:15:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-29T10:15:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26807</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-29T09:15:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-29T10:15:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36401</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-29T09:15:18Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-29T10:15:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>47534</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-29T09:15:21Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-29T10:15:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>59877</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-29T10:15:24Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-29T10:15:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>73358</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-29T10:15:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-29T10:15:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>88174</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-19T00:32:21Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-11-29T10:15:27Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>3</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10444</id><name>Zarina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Zarina is a widow with three children. Her husband died when she had just given birth to their third child. She was left with the sole responsibility of providing for herself and her children. It was not an easy task for a woman in Uganda, but she was determined to obtain a job as a housekeeper in Kampala. It was through this job that she was introduced to Life in Africa. She has been an active member for the last six years.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Zarina was forced to leave school at a very early age due to the civil war. Her family lost everything during this conflict and she was never able to return to school. This left her with poor English skills, and she was barely able to read or write. However, she knew the values of education, and she has made it her life‘s goal to make sure that her children are all educated. This goal prompted her to look for a way to secure their future.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Zarina proved to be a smart business woman, and she saw the advantage of investing in income property. She managed to secure several loans through Life in Africa, and she built a solid housing unit in a poor section of Kampala. She has several tenants living in her property now, and she was able to pay back all her loans in a timely manner. Like any other Life in Africa member, she was among the first to take a loan of 800,000 from Kiva in May 2006.  She used her loan money to plaster her house, which ensured the quality of housing for her tenants. In addition, it also insured the value and durability of her property. She has repaid her loans without ever having a single late payment. Before plastering her house, she was earning 200,000 per month and is now earning 280,000 per month.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Zarina feels that she should put a ceiling board in her four roomed house so that it may look attractive to her tenants and also may increase the house rent. Any additions to the house increase the rent, which would raise her income. To do this she is requesting a loan amount of 150 USD.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>150</funded_amount><paid_amount>150</paid_amount><image><id>36976</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Construction</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>Putting a celing board in the house</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Kyebando, Kampala</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>2 33</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>8</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-21T01:11:58Z</posted_date><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Zarina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-04T03:02:25Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>150</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-29T09:15:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-29T09:15:18Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26808</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-29T09:15:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-29T09:15:18Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36402</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-29T09:15:18Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-29T09:15:18Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>47535</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-21T03:02:25Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-29T09:15:18Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10445</id><name>Moreen</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>M.

Denis is 23 and was born in Lacekocot, a village in the Pader district. He has the responsibility in his family for paying his younger brother&apos;s school fees. Denis has managed this for several years through a small barbershop he owns, complemented by additional painting and construction work.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Denis is also an active volunteer at a charitable organization called Charity for Peace. In 2003 insecurity in Northern Uganda was intense, and many helpless children were forced to sleep on the verandas of town buildings and escape abductions from rebels in surrounding villages. Together with other Charity for Peace volunteers, Denis started finding and relocating the children to night commuter centers to keep them safe. In addition, Denis helped clean up sleeping areas and helped teach the children how to live among themselves.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;For around 3 years he volunteered without earning much money until Life in Africa began offering income, generating opportunities for Charity for Peace volunteers. Denis did not stop volunteering at night, but with the Life in Africa programs he started making paper beads, peace tiles, bracelets and other crafts during the day to earn income to support himself and his family. Through Life in Africa&apos;s computer training courses, Denis is now able to operate computers. He is a hard working young man who was recently appointed to serve on Life in Africa&apos;s quality control team. This increased Denis&apos; monthly income to nearly 240,000.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;To have a job with a stable income in addition to the barbershop, Denis intends to purchase a phone set which will help him generate additional income. His sister will be in charge of the pay phone, as he will be engaged in Life in Africa activities, and she will earn part of the profit. The pay phone will be located at the Layibi railway, where his barbershop is located. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;He plans to refund the loan after four months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>150</funded_amount><paid_amount>150</paid_amount><image><id>36979</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Phone Use Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Buying phone and airtime</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Te - Gwana, Gulu</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>2 33</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>8</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-22T22:26:57Z</posted_date><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Denis</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-05T22:52:14Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>150</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>38</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-29T09:15:13Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-29T09:15:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>38</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26810</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>38</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-29T09:15:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-29T09:15:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>38</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36404</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>38</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-29T09:15:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-29T09:15:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>38</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>47537</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>36</amount><local_amount>36</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-29T09:15:21Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-29T09:15:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>36</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>59879</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-22T22:52:14Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-09-29T09:15:21Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10447</id><name>Micheal</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Michael A. is married and has two children. He had been working as a carpenter before joining Life in Africa. When he is not working at LiA, Michael works as a part-time carpenter to support his family.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Michael moved from Amuru to Gulu because of the growing conflict and dangers in Amuru. When he first moved to Gulu, he found life to be difficult, but when he began working as a carpenter again, he found the transition to be easier. He helped build the materials necessary to construct the Awere Secondary School, which offered education for displaced children. Currently, Michael leads the construction of all of Life in Africa’s buildings at the WE Gulu Center. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Currently Michael is employed with Life in Africa as the production manager. He began this job as a volunteer because he saw it was necessary to aid in the organization of the producers. His work was satisfactory, and he eventually began getting paid. He is happy with the Life in Africa program because it has greatly changed his standard of living and his family life. He can now raise over 300,000 ushs/month for his living.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Michael plans to use his loan of 150 USD to purchase a phone set. He will place the phone under the charge of his wife, and he believes that by operating the phone, he will be able to make 70,000 ushs. The money he makes from his public pay phone would be used to help pay for domestic necessities such as food and his loans.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;He plans to repay the loan after a period of 3 months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>150</funded_amount><paid_amount>150</paid_amount><image><id>36980</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Phone Use Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>buying pay phone set.</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Te - Gwana, Gulu</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>2 33</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>8</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-21T20:49:43Z</posted_date><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Micheal</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-04T22:35:46Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>150</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-29T09:15:13Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-29T09:15:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26811</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-29T09:15:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-29T09:15:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36405</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-29T09:15:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-29T09:15:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>47538</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-21T22:35:46Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-29T09:15:19Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10448</id><name>Pich</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Pich T., 42 years old, has two children and lives with her husband in Preyveng, Cambodia.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Maria and her husband Mario have been living on their land for about ten years now. They have been able to slowly build their home out of hard work, although it is still admittedly in need of much improvement. Maria has a 7 year old daughter who she works hard to feed and educate. Her husband is a field worker who is mostly employed in big farms outside of their town. Meanwhile, Maria tends to their own piece of land with the help of Mario whenever he is out of work or she really needs him. They hope to invest in fertilizer and pesticides to preserve the crops they have already planted. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of one the new Communal Banks formed in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Anzuelo Baba Communal Bank are part of an association of rice farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their organization, El Anzuelo Asociacion, works cooperatively to help their members cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. Most recently, El Anzuelo was able to start a program that improved their members access to watering services.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of La Asociacion El Anzuelo de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other’s guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  &#13;&#10;companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  &#13;&#10;as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financing, they have turned to loan sharks, paying between 100% and 240% annual interest.  Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and earn fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is a severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>825</funded_amount><paid_amount>825</paid_amount><image><id>37001</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice farming.</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-28T02:48:14Z</posted_date><loan_amount>825</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maria</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-11T18:16:09Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>825</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>825</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-11T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-11T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>66</amount><local_amount>66</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T17:00:06Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T17:00:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23691</payment_id><comment>1er pago asociación el anzuelo</comment></payment><payment><amount>66</amount><local_amount>66</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-17T21:39:42Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T17:00:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>33125</payment_id><comment>2do pago asoc el anzuelo</comment></payment><payment><amount>633</amount><local_amount>633</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-18T18:24:36Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T17:00:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>633</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>99068</payment_id><comment>6to pago</comment></payment><payment><amount>60</amount><local_amount>60</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-14T17:00:25Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T17:00:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>60</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>210202</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-28T18:16:09Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-05-14T17:00:25Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10451</id><name>Soum</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Soum R. is 29 years old and is a mother of two children.

She is unmarried and supports her family working for the social security agency in her city.  The family is living in a three-room home which is not yet completed as the brick walls still need to be plastered.  This loan will pay to plaster, paint and trim in the home&apos;s interior.  This is the first loan Mrs. O. has requested from  IMPRO.  Our credit check shows she will be able to repay the loan.  &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated by a Kiva volunteer.  &lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt; Beatriz  vive con sus dos hijos de 15 y 18 años en su vivienda de la zona de Tembladerani, zona sopocachi de la ciudad de La Paz, no tiene esposo, por lo que la señora mantiene a la familia trabajando en la institución de seguro social de esta ciudad.&#13;&#10;La casa de la señora Beatriz cuenta con tres habitaciones que las están habitando pero que aun no están concluidas en su construcción, pues están en obra gruesa (muros de ladrillo y cemento sin revoque).&#13;&#10;El destino del crédito es para el acabado en obra fina de tres habitaciones; revoque, carpintería y pintura interior.&#13;&#10;Es la primera ocasión que la señora O. solicita un préstamo en nuestra institución y el análisis crediticio muestran que podrá cubrir sus obligaciones producto del crédito.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>37047</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Construction</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>Construction.</use><location><country_code>BO</country_code><country>Bolivia</country><town>La

He is 36 years old and is separated from his wife.  He has been caring for his children for two years.  He travels to Desaguadero to buy items like plastic washtubs and laundry baskets to resell.  Depending on the season, he also sells pots and pans and electric appliances at economic prices.  He is asking for this loan to increase his capital and be able to expand his inventory and increase his income.  He has not borrowed from IMPRO before, but his profits are good and he should be able to repay without problems.  &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated by a Kiva volunteer &lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pastor vive en casa de sus padres en la calle 5 de agosto de la zona de Tembladerani de la Ciudad de La Paz; tiene 36 años de edad, esta separado de la esposa y mantiene a sus dos hijos desde hace dos años. El es comerciante minorista y realiza viajes a Desaguadero, lugar donde se provee de productos de plásticos como ser bañadores, cestos de ropa, bañeras etc. Además de estos productos también vende ollas, artefactos eléctricos, según la temporada, a precios que sean mas económicos y es mas accesibles al consumidor.&#13;&#10;El crédito que solicita es para aumentar su capital y traer mayor

For several years her ex-husband would send her money in order to help cover the expenses for her household but now she is fully dependent upon her business. She opened her small store thanks to the support of her aunt who always encouraged her to find a means to sustain herself. From her small store she sells a variety of products ranging from condiments to detergent. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Elsa is a repeat Kiva and Mifex borrower. She has done great with her first loan. Elsa first invested her money in increasing the inventory of her store. Once she made her capital back and increased profits, she went on to make adjustments to her store and home. She finished building a section of the store out of cement and now it is much bigger and accommodates many more goods. She will use her second loan to purchase the goods to fill the new space in her store.

Because of renovations in the market, which were being done by the city, they lost their spot there.

Rosa realiza su recorrido todos los días de la semana desde las 6: AM a 18: PM              &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Rosa necesita mas capital para poder invertirlo en comprar mas frutas.  Sus ventas han aumentado y su capital no le permite poder surtirlo con más productos.   &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Rosa tiene 43  años 1 hija que ya esta casada y no depende de ella. Con las readecuaciones dada por municipio ella también perdió su terreno y vivienda. Rosa fue reubicada en otro terreno en sector diferente dentro de la isla. Con esta situación Rosa tubo que construir su vivienda y esto genero gastos y su capital se fue bajando.  Rosa tiene la fe de que con el crédito sus ganancias se incrementaran y podrá dar algo de ellas para seguir adecuando su vivienda ya que aun su piso esta en tierra.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>37164</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To buy more fruit</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Guayaquil</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-2.166667 -79.9</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-25T01:39:17Z</posted_date><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Rosa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-08T12:26:43Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>600</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-08T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-08T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-31T09:15:17Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:15:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>37151</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-31T09:15:24Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:15:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>48489</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-30T09:15:41Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:15:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>60238</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-31T10:15:15Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:15:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>74261</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-30T10:15:36Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:15:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>88593</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-25T12:26:43Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-11-30T10:15:36Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10515</id><name>Romelía</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Romelia has a business selling fast foods, such as hamburgers, hot dogs, and French fries.

She began with a loan of 15 cylinders that her brother gave her. Little by little, she has been building her capital and has been able to grow. She currently has 150 cylinders of natural gas. She works almost 24 hours a day, along with her daughters, who help her in her business. She works every day of the week, and when she runs out of gas, she leaves to get more. &lt;p&gt; Patricia wants the loan in order to invest in buying more cylinders of natural gas. Demand has increased, especially at night, and little by little she is becoming a distributor of the product. &lt;p&gt;Patricia is a single mother. She is 50 years old and has 2 daughters. She is currently renting her business space. In the future, she hopes to be able to buy a second-hand cart, which would help her in the business. In this way, she will be able to cover the needs of her customers. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Patricia  tiene una experiencia de 2 años con el servicio de venta de gas de uso domésticos. Se inicio con el préstamo de 15 cilindros que le dio un hermano. Poco a poco fue haciendo su capital y ha logrado crecer. Actualmente cuenta con 150 cilindros de gas.  Trabaja casi las 24 horas del día junto a sus hijas que le ayudan en su negocio. Todos los días de la semana y cuando no tiene gas sale a recorrer para conseguirlo.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Patricia desea el crédito para poder invertir en la compra de mas cilindros de gas. Ya que su demanda sobre todo por las noches ha aumentado y poco a poco se esta haciendo distribuidora del producto.   &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Patricia es madre soltera. Tiene 50 años y dos hijas. Actualmente ella arrienda el local donde tiene su negocio. A futuro espera poder comprarse un carrito de segunda que le ayude en el negocio y de esta manera poder cubrir la necesidad de sus clientes.     &lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>37169</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home Products Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To buy more cylinders of natural gas</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Guayaquil</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-2.166667 -79.9</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-25T01:41:25Z</posted_date><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Patricia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-08T20:13:58Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>600</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-08T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-08T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-04T09:15:15Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-04T10:15:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>28754</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-04T09:15:22Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-04T10:15:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>38722</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-04T09:15:22Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-04T10:15:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>50304</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-04T09:15:18Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-04T10:15:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>62618</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-04T10:15:24Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-04T10:15:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>76004</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-04T10:15:16Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-04T10:15:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>90995</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-25T20:13:58Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-04T10:15:16Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10519</id><name>Agnes</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Agnes is a single mother of four, with three undergoing their ‘O’ levels, and one in primary school.

She is married and has two daughters, ages 23 and 25, the youngest of which is still going to school. A long time ago, Leticia was a secretary, but it didn&apos;t leave her much time to spend with her family. So, 18 years ago, she decided to start her own beauty shop. She started with a mirror and a chair in a corner of her home; she didn&apos;t have all the necessary equipment. But thanks to her hard work, she has a room in her home set aside for business and has arranged it, little by little, to offer her customers a better service.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Currently, she is well known within her neighborhood for her quality of service and has a lot of clients. With a lot of hard work, she has seen her business grow. She wants to this continue, so she&apos;s requesting a loan of $925, which will be used to buy the supplies needed to continue on her work — dyes, bleach, shampoos, etc. She plans to repay the loan within six to 12 months.

Nadezhda realizes that Nadiya (Hope) Ukraine has been a substantial support for her small venture. She readily admits that lending services have helped her business grow and flourish. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Nadezhda has requested a loan for $900 to increase her product variety. She believes that kids are bright, funny, adorable, funky, and so much more and doesn’t want to offer them boring footwear. That is why she is planning to purchase a range of versatile athletic shoes, casual footwear, and sandals for all different age groups of children. We believe that increased funding will help her ongoing success and will allow her to continue to improve the quality of life for her family.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>37378</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Increase product variety</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Melitopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>46.842222 35.373056</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-24T01:23:28Z</posted_date><loan_amount>900</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Nadezhda</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-11T01:39:27Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>900</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>900</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-10T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-10T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T09:18:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:30:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27350</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-30T09:17:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:30:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36859</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-30T09:19:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:30:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>48097</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-30T09:27:55Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:30:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>60646</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-30T10:19:06Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:30:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>73911</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-30T10:30:25Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:30:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>89009</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-28T01:39:27Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-11-30T10:30:25Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10550</id><name>Nina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Nina is divorced and has one daughter.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Eight years ago, Olga found her niche at the Kosmicheski Market in Zaporoshie when she opened her small business selling eyeglasses and frames. As the weather gets warmer in Ukraine, her small business blooms even more with the additional sales of sunglasses.  Over the years, Olga has acquired solid experience selling both sunglasses and prescription glasses. Through her determination and hard work she has been able to build a loyal customer base that has even begun to pre-order their eyewear from her – not a small feat considering her many competitors. Olga’s business has led to a stable profit of $200-$300 a month from more then $600 of invested inventory.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Today, Olga is asking for a loan of $500 to help increase her working capital and buy additional sunglasses for the warmer season. She understands that new selections will help her satisfy the needs of her customers. Her goal is to see each customer leave with a pair of glasses that they like.

She runs a small business selling plastic dishware and other small items in the central city market. She has been in this business for 10 years. Currently her gross income is about $1,500 and her monthly net profit amounts to $300. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Valentina started as a market vendor selling tea and coffee. However, on her sister’s advice she later changed her business activity and introduced new products in her kiosk – plastic dishware, bags, paper towels, and other small necessities. Today, this business is the only source of income for her family. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Valentina would like to receive a loan of $500 to increase her inventory supply. Income generated from her business will allow her to invest more in her son’s education as well as provide a better living for her family. We believe that Valentina’s consistency and responsibility which have helped her repay 14 previous loans will guarantee the prompt repayment of this current loan.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>37384</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Plastics Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Increase inventory</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Melitopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>46.842222 35.373056</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-24T16:27:29Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Valentina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-07T22:37:22Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-07T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-07T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-25T09:17:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-25T10:18:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>25929</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-25T09:17:29Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-25T10:18:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35238</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-25T09:17:57Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-25T10:18:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>46132</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-25T09:17:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-25T10:18:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>58395</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-25T09:17:59Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-25T10:18:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>71632</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-25T10:18:17Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-25T10:18:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>86273</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-24T22:37:22Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-11-25T10:18:17Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10556</id><name>Lacin</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Lacin N. is a native of the Aghsu region of Azerbaijan.

They operate two sales locations where they offer a selection of men’s and women’s sports apparel and shoes. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Their business has an interesting history. In 2003 Vladimir owned a business that sold vodka and wine. He approached Nadiya Ukraine about the possibility of getting a loan but was turned down because of our policy of not supporting businesses that sell alcohol – alcoholism is a huge problem in Ukraine. He was encouraged, however, to find another type of business and he decided to do just that. Using funding from a loan he was able to start a new venture selling sports apparel. Since that time his business has done quite well. He has been able to buy and remodel two sales locations and has built up around $10,000 worth of inventory. He typically will purchase about $3,000 worth of new inventory each month. Vladimir is quite a businessman and we are happy that he has chosen to apply his talents in a business that is constructive rather than destructive.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Vladimir has requested an additional loan to give him more working capital to use in his business. It will be exciting to see how Vladimir’s enterprise will continue to grow in the future – he’s off to a great start.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>37409</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Increase inventory</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Nikopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>47.566667 34.4</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-25T01:43:47Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Vladimir</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-22T17:16:02Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-12T09:19:26Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:21:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31310</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-12T09:21:24Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:21:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>41772</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-12T09:20:18Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:21:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>53555</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-12T09:19:39Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:21:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>66320</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-12T10:21:09Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:21:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>80306</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-12T10:21:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:21:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>95739</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-08T17:16:02Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-12T10:21:50Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10573</id><name>Elena</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Like many entrepreneurs in Ukraine, Elena’s dream was to be self-employed.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Ludmila runs a prosperous little clothing sales kiosk at the Pervomaiski Rhinok  (market) in Nikopol, Ukraine. A teacher by profession, she decided to open her own business about ten years ago and has done very well. She sells a variety of women’s skirts, blouses, and dresses.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Income from Ludmila’s business helped her and her husband, Victor, build their own home. Her income also helps provide for her two children – a son aged 23 and daughter, 17. Ludmila is typical of many women entrepreneurs who desire to earn extra income to provide a better living for their families.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ludmila has requested a loan for $800 to use to help her purchase additional inventory to sell. She typically will buy about $400 worth of clothes from her suppliers three times a month. This allows her to maintain an adequate amount of inventory on hand and she can easily update her product selection if an item is selling well or not moving quickly enough. Ludmila’s business has benefited much from loans she has received in the past. We believe that this loan will continue to help her business be successful and provide much needed income for Ludmila and her family.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>37416</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Increase inventory</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Nikopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>47.566667 34.4</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-25T20:39:13Z</posted_date><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ludmila</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-16T03:52:07Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>800</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-08T09:18:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>30246</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-08T09:18:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>40300</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-08T09:19:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>52124</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-08T09:20:33Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>64712</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-08T10:21:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>78291</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>130</amount><local_amount>130</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-08T10:22:35Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>130</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>93540</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-02T03:52:07Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-08T10:22:35Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10577</id><name>Natalya</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Natalya has had her men’s clothing business at the market in Nikopol for nearly nine years. Her business has provided much-needed income for her and her husband, Igor, as they’ve raised their two children – a daughter, 24, and son, 21. Currently, Natalya offers a variety of men’s clothing from shirts and dress coats to sweaters and shoes.

She’d like to use some as working capital to buy necessary inventory, but her primary goal is to use some funds to help open a new vending kiosk.

They own their own home in Rio Seco in the city of El Alto.  They purchased it in 2004 with savings from an &quot;anticretico&quot;.  [Translators note:  An antichretic, or land-pawn, contract is an interesting rent-to-own arrangement common in Bolivia.  You can read about it here:    http://www.escapeartist.com/OREQ3/Rent_Free_Bolivia.html]  The house is fifteen years old and made of stuccoed adobe.  The shell has suffered with age and needs to be repaired.  This loan will pay for removing the damaged exterior and replacing it with one of slaked lime or cement, which is more waterproof.  This is the Z. family&apos;s first loan from IMPRO.  Our study of their finances shows they will be able to repay the loan.  &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated by a Kiva volunteer. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt; El señor Luis Z. junto a su esposa, la señora Magda Calvimontes y sus hijos José y Fernanda de 7 y 5 años, son propietarios de una vivienda en la zona de Río Seco, ciudad de El Alto, adquirida el año 2004 con ahorros provenientes de un anticrético. &#13;&#10;El señor Z. trabaja en una empresa de servicios en la misma ciudad y su esposa es ama de casa.&#13;&#10;La vivienda, dado el tiempo y las características constructivas (La casa es de adobe revocado con estuco y su fabricación data de hace quince años), ha sufrido un deterioro que requiere refacción.&#13;&#10;El destino del crédito es para limpiar los muros exteriores del revoque ya deteriorado y realizar uno nuevo recubrimiento con cal, material de mayor impermeabilización.&#13;&#10;Es la primera ocasión que la familia Z. solicita un préstamo en nuestra institución y el análisis crediticio muestran que podrá cubrir sus obligaciones producto del crédito.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>37420</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Construction</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>Home

She is 55 years old and cooks food to sell from a stand in front of her home.  The family helps her with the business.  This loan will increase her working capital.  At this time she buys rice, meat and vegetables retail, but with the large number of customers to feed she is now cooking in volume and needs to start buying in bulk.  She has not borrowed from IMPRO before but qualifies for this loan on the strength of her business.  &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated by a Kiva volunteer. &lt;p&gt; &lt;/b&gt;  Emiliana vive en casa propia en la Av. Jaimes Freyre de la ciudad de La Paz con su esposo y su hija; tiene 55 años de edad, se dedica a la venta de comida en un kiosco ubicado en la puerta de su casa con lo cual mantiene a su familia. El crédito que solicita es para aumentar su capital ya que ahora compra al raleo arroz, carne, verduras etc. La afluencia de gente a su kiosco hace que ella se vea en la necesidad de cocinar en cantidad, por lo tanto necesita comprar al por mayor &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;No tiene antecedente con Impro, pero su forma de trabajar la califica como cliente y puede acceder  un crédito.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>37422</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

Her husband is employed as a security guard, but his earnings do not cover the expenses of the family. Mariatu&apos;s small restaurant income is a crucial supplement to the overall family income.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mariatu sells cooked rice with cassava leaves, palm oil, peanut paste, mixed with fish and meat (local dishes in Sierra Leone). She is open everyday. Due to low working capital, Mariatu buys the ingredients in small quantities on a daily basis. At times this can be more expensive, especially when the palm oil and the local rice are out of season. Traveling several times to the village market to purchase the items leaves Mariatu with less time to attend to her business. She will use the loan funds for the purchase of fifty gallons of palm oil and three bags of rice (50kgs). This will enable her to have enough stock at a stable price and save the time of frequent travel to the village market to do purchases. Mariatu is determined to provide her three children with a good education by covering their school expenses.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>37501</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Mariatu

Like many Paraguayans, he emigrated to Argentina when he was young and it is there that he learned his craft.  His whole family helps him with his work.  They have all learned the craft, and while his children are still in school they feel that what they&apos;ve already learned will serve them to earn a living.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Victor not only makes and sells his product, but he also teaches leatherwork to young people in his neighborhood, charging them $3 an hour.  He plans to use this loan to make more of his most popular product--a leather wristband scented with citronella used to repel mosquitoes.  These are popular because the country is plagued by an epidemic of Dengue fever.  He needs to increase his income because not only are his three children still in school but his 48-year-old wife has recently begun to finish her secondary education.  &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated by a Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Victor tiene 48 años y es casado con 3 hijos.  Como tantos paraguayos, emigro en su juventud a la Argentina donde aprendió el oficio. En la fabricación de sus productos trabaja con sus tres hijos y su esposa. Todos han aprendido el oficio y aunque continúan estudiando, consideran que lo aprendido ya les sirve para ganarse la vida. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Victor no solo fabrica y vende sus productos, sino que además capacita a los jóvenes del  mercado municipal que están interesados en aprender el oficio, cobrando por sus servicios US$ 3 la hora. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Planea utilizar el crédito para comprar materia prima para aumentar la producción de su mas exitoso producto: la pulsera repelente de mosquitos, fabricada a base de citronella. Este producto tiene una alta demanda debido a la epidemia de dengue que afecta el país.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Necesita generar más ingreso, ya que no solo sus tres hijos continúan su educación, sino que su esposa de 48 años ha reanudado sus estudios secundarios.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>37483</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Crafts</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>To

She is a long-time resident of Pelopincho, the largest of Asuncion&apos;s marginal neighborhoods.  She appears strong and healthy, but older than her years.  She hawks cosmetics and clothing that she buys in Clorinda, Argentina, on the border near Asuncion.  At night, she collects cardboard downtown to recycle.  Between these two activities she earns about $40 a week with which she supports two of her six children and helps the older ones, who have children of their own. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;For the last year, she has been a member of the Tekoyeyoya support committee, along with 14 other women from her neighborhood.  She relates with sadness how she is separated from her husband.  &quot;He was a drunk and didn&apos;t work,&quot;  she says.  &quot;When he drank he got crazy.&quot;  She left him nine years ago, and it&apos;s as if he were dead to her.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since then she has raised her children alone.  She takes pride in never having let her children or grandchildren beg in the street.  &quot;I thank God for giving me the strength to keep fighting,&quot; she says with tears in her eyes.  She wants the best for her family and her community.  She says that the group &quot;taught her how to share responsibility.&quot;  &quot;The women help each other with their problems, and that way we all come out ahead together.&quot; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated by a Kiva volunteer. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Doña Maria Pabla K. de Medina, es una señora de 47 años.  Es antigua moradora de Pelopincho, el más grande de los barrios marginales de Asunción. Se la ve fuerte y sana, pero aparenta más edad de la que tiene.  Doña Pabla es vendedora ambulante de cosméticos y ropas que trae de Clorinda, una ciudad argentina en la frontera cercana a Asunción.  Por la noche, sube al centro de la ciudad y recicla cartones.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ambas actividades le proporcionan un ingreso de 40 dólares semanales con lo que mantiene a dos de sus seis hijos y ayuda a los mayores, que a su vez tienen hijos pequeños.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Desde el año pasado forma parte del comité “Tekoyeyoyá”, junto a otras 14 vecinas y amigas del barrio.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Doña Pabla cuenta con tristeza que tuvo que separarse de su marido porque “era borracho y no tenía trabajo” y “cuando tomaba bebida alcohólica, se ponía como loco”.  Hace nueve años que lo dejó y para ella es como si su marido hubiera muerto.  Desde entonces asumió ella sola la crianza de sus hijos.     &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Asegura con orgullo que nunca permitió que sus hijos pidieran limosna en las calles y tampoco permite que lo hagan sus nietos.  “Le pido a Dios que me de fuerzas para seguir luchando”, dice emocionada, con lágrimas en los ojos, porque quiere lo mejor para su familia y para su comunidad.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Del grupo “aprendí lo que es la responsabilidad con los demás”, nos cuenta.  “Todas las señoras nos ayudamos en nuestros problemas y así salimos adelante todos juntos”.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>150</funded_amount><paid_amount>150</paid_amount><image><id>37494</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cosmetics Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To buy a case of nail polish and hand cream.</use><location><country_code>PY</country_code><country>Paraguay</country><town>Asunción</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>-22.993333 -57.996389</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>58</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-23T18:53:47Z</posted_date><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maria Pabla</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-06T20:02:30Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>150</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>38</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-06T09:26:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-06T19:33:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>38</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>29704</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>38</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-06T09:28:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-06T19:33:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>38</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>39715</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>38</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-07T01:32:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-06T19:33:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>38</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>51380</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>36</amount><local_amount>36</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-06T19:33:14Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-06T19:33:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>36</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>64003</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-23T20:02:30Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-06T19:33:14Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10613</id><name>Rosa</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Rosa S. and her husband Juan T. Perez work together in their small businesses.  Rosa weaves and sews the fabric herself.  She has two sewing machines purchased with help from a Puente de Amistad loan.  She and her husband sell corn and beans in Santa Avelina, and when they aren&apos;t out selling they work at home.  He does carpentry and she weaves and together they tend a small shop where they sell traditional clothing and kitchen ware.  She now keeps her wares bundled because she doesn&apos;t have much space but with this loan she would like to buy a display stand.  Puente de Amistad has been a great help for Rosa and her family.  She has worked hard to build her business because the family could not get by on her husband&apos;s income alone.  These loans have helped her a great deal to her raise her children and give them a good education. &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated by a Kiva volunteer. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rosa S. y su esposo Juan T. Perez trabajan juntos en sus pequeños negocios.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#9;Rosa hace tejidos y ella misma las cose a maquina ya que con sus ganancias y el crédito de Puente de Amistad ella ha comprado dos maquinas.  Con su esposo ella vende maíz y fríjol en la aldea de Santa Avelina, y cuando no salen a vender  su esposo se dedica a la carpintería y ella se dedica a tejer y cuidar a su pequeña tienda donde tiene: Morales Típicos, Güipiles, Rebozos y Utensilios de cocina.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rosa tienen todo su venta junto porque no cuenta con mucho espacio pero si Dios le da vida para otro crédito piensa en comprar un mostrador para colocar su venta. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#9;Puente de Amistad a sido una gran ayuda para Rosa y su familia, ya que se ha esforzado en surtir su negocio para poder sostener a su familia porque si solo el esposo trabajara no alcanza el dinero.  El credito ha ayudado bastante a Rosa, y es asi como ella ha podido darle a sus hijos una vida y una educación mejor.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>37495</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Crafts</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Making traditional textiles and sales of kitchen wares, corn and beans.</use><location><country_code>GT</country_code><country>Guatemala</country><town>Cantón Xeacan  Cotzal</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>15.5 -90.25</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>55</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-24T16:27:11Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Rosa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-07T22:28:16Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-07T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-08T09:19:54Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-08T10:28:03Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>30321</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-08T09:20:52Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-08T10:28:03Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>40385</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-08T09:22:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-08T10:28:03Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>52222</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-08T09:23:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-08T10:28:03Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>64811</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-08T10:28:03Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-08T10:28:03Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>78425</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-24T22:28:16Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-11-08T10:28:03Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10614</id><name>Muhamed</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Muhamed is 28 years old and single.

She also has a related business cooking traditional food which she serves in her home, especially to the groups of women who gather there to repay their loans and discuss how they can help each other solve their problems.  Adriana would like help to learn about poultry vaccination so she can do it herself.  Her dream is to use this credit to raise more poultry and someday, hopefully, to buy a cow.  &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated by a Kiva volunteer. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt; Con el crédito, Adriana compraria mas Gallinas y Chompipes porque actualmente tiene poquitos.
