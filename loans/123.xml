Since 2000, she has been selling groceries in front of her home and is able to earn up to US$1 of profit per day. Her husband, Hing Sim, age 45, is a local construction worker who has built houses since 1993.  He is able to earn around US$4 per day.  Mrs. Tak P. used to be a housewife but her husband’s income was not enough to support the family, so she started selling groceries to help with the family&apos;s expenses. Together, the couple has three children, two of whom are employed and the other one is too young to work.&#13;&#10;Mrs. Tak P. is seeking a loan of US$500 from Kiva via Credit, a local partner, to add to her inventory of groceries, as she has many customers now.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>192184</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

Since 2000, she has sold beef to earn a living and is able to earn up to US$3 of profit per day. Her husband, Hel Ly, age 36, is a local butcher who provides meat for her to sell. Mrs. T. told a loan officer that prior to selling beef she was a vendor selling vegetables and her husband was a construction worker who built houses.  However, both had to change professions due to problems.  She told a loan officer that every month she needs to pay for food that costs around US$35 and utilities that cost about US$5. Together, this couple has three children, two of whom are employed and one is too young to work.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. El T. is seeking a loan of US$1,000 to purchase cow for her husband to kill for

Since 2006, she has been selling a variety of groceries to earn a living and is able to earn up to US$5 of profit per day. Her husband, age 30, has a business running a motor-taxi to help support his family and is able to earn up to US$3 of profit each day. Both of them were farmers before starting these businesses, but had to change their work because of bad weather conditions. In their village, there is no irrigation system so their family and other villagers depend on the weather to farm.  They are all very happy when there are dark clouds, but if there is no rain their crops or rice are damaged. Every month, this couple needs to pay around US$75 for food, US$10 for utilities, and US$50 for their children&apos;s education.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Say S. is seeking a loan of US$600 to add to her grocery inventory to meet her customers&apos; demands. (Mrs. S.&apos;s mother is pictured because Mrs. Say S. and her husband were not available.)&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;CREDIT MFI is an independent Cambodian faith-based organization. It aims to empower the economically active poor and small entrepreneurs by providing inclusive financial services.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>192173</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

Kandal Province.  Mrs. Koem T. is the Village Bank President. She was born in 1965. Mrs. Koem T. has three children, two of whom are door-making workers; the youngest oN. is attending school.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Koem T. owns a small piece of land on which she grows mango trees. She now faces a problem because the plantation has been damaged by insects. Therefore, Mrs. Koem T. decided to ask for a loan to buy pesticides to kill all the insects in order to make her crop more productive. Aside from this business, Mrs. Koem T. is a grocer. Her husband, Mr. Khiev Samoeurn, always assists his wife in both businesses.

She is the Village Bank President who has been selected by the members. This Village Bank consists of fifteen members. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Sok K. sells vegetables in the local market. Since her business is going well, Mrs. Sok K. decided to ask for a loan to buy more vegetables to sell. Her husband, Mr. Toeb Seab, is a house construction foreman who usually works outside the village. Mrs. Sok K. has eight children, two of whom are construction workers while another one sells vegetables with her. Three others stay at home and cook food for the household, while the remaining two are attending high

Sophorn is a farmer who lives in Phteah Rung Commune, Pursat Province. She is married and lives with her husband and their eight children. Two of the children are married, and the others are young. Sophorn and her husband work hard every day to support their large family.  She grows rice crops in the rainy season; this is a main source of income for her family. &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Now it is the rainy season and time for farming.

He is married with two adorable kids. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Farrukh has been breeding cattle since he was a young boy. He is a purposeful person. He likes animals and enjoys looking after them. Being in this business for 11 years, he knows very well how to choose the animals, how to breed them and look after them. Thus, he gets up every morning in five o’clock in order to feed the animals and to look after them.  His knowledge and skills allow him to make his business successful and generate a stable, considerable income for his large family. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Today, knowing that the prices for the animals are not so high now, but will increase for sure, Farrukh is planning to add to his livestock and to purchase cattle and calves. With this purpose in mind,  he is requesting 2000 Somoni (600 USD) for a term of 12 months. Farrukh thanks all for trusting and supporting him and promises to repay the loan promptly.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>192215</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Purchasing

She’s married with two children. The difficult circumstances and hardships in her life made her recognize the value of work from a very young age. For about 10 years she has been purchasing young cattle in the local market to fatten and sell in local markets. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Baroat is a very hard-working woman, and her diligence is incredible. She works with a strength worthy of immense admiration. She has always looked for a way to be an important protagonist by providing extra income to her home. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Baroat wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and selling them at the best price in the local market. She started this occupation because of the recommendation and teaching of her beloved mother. Thanks to this activity she is supporting her children with education. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Baroat wants to keep on educating them because she hopes that they’ll reach the goals that they have laid out for themselves. &lt;P&gt;With this purpose in mind, she is requesting a loan of 2000 Somoni (600 USD) with a term of 12 months to buy a calf in order to expand her business and to improve the living conditions of the family. Let’s support this brave woman who has a lot of courage and strength to live. Your generosity can change their lives.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>192220</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Purchasing

She runs a small business selling fabrics in the central market.  She would like to get a loan to buy winter fabrics to prepare for the coming colder fall and winter seasons. Davlatmoh buys the fabrics in Dushanbe. She has been in this business for 18 years, after her husband left her alone with six children to support. Since then she has tried to give her children everything within her means. Her oldest son is about to start university and so she is working as hard as she can. She plans to repay the loan within 10 months.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva

Her husband, Mr. Chhun Mech, is a palm juice collector who gathers juice to process into palm sugar or palm wine.  He also assists in his wife&apos;s business when he has free time.

Two of his cows have given birth so it is important that he increases the size of his cow barn. That is why he wants to receive a loan so that he can buy building materials. By building a strong cow barn he will be able to be well prepared for the winter and not worry that the cold weather would injure the cows. He plans to repay the loan within 12 months.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Maria Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Азимов Аминджон житель города Яван.

She and her husband have been farmers since they got married. They grow vegetables, and on average they make around 1 dollar per day. Mrs. Ty told a loan officer that it is difficult to earn a living as a farmer because there are no irrigation systems in most provinces, and the weather condition is very bad as well. Farmers depend on the weather to get more output. She continues, farmers are very happy when there are dark clouds, but if there is no rain they will face crop damages. This couple has two children who are married and live away from home.&#13;&#10;Mrs. Ty L. is seeking a loan of $500 from Kiva to purchase a cart that will allow her drain the juice from sugar cane plants to earn an extra profit.

Back then, her family’s main source of income came from farming, breeding pigs and fishes, but they didn’t generate a lot of income. Consequentially, Mrs. T. decided to rent a place to start buying and selling wastes. Mrs. T. used the loan of the first round to invest in poultries, but she didn’t make much profit. Learning the mistake, Mrs. T. since then has invested the loans from TYM in her business, from which she earns about 200000 VND per day. The business has aided her family financially a great deal. In the next round of loan, Mrs. T. would like to ask for 9.000.000 VND ($550) to expand her business. Her family’s monthly income is about 6.000.000 VND. &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva

As Mrs. H. and her family live in the countryside, the main source of income for them comes from farming. To enhance the family’s income, Mrs. H. considered raising poultries, but back then she didn’t have the capital to put her plan into practice. This motivated her to become a member of TYM Fund, from whom she would be able to request for loans. In the first round of loan, Mrs. H. asked for 3.000.000 VND, which she used to buy pigs, ducks and raised them. As a result, the family’s financial situation has been improved a lot. Mrs. H. is currently breeding 9 pigs for meat and 200 ducks for eggs. In this round, Mrs. H. would like to ask for 9.000.000 VND to invest in poultries. Her family’s monthly income is about 5.000.000 VND. &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by KH.

Thi Vy is 36 years old. Before joining the fund, her family&apos;s financial situation was difficult because the main source of their income came totally from farming. The first loan with TYM was for 180.00 USD and she invested in her business of selling mats. Since then, the family&apos;s income has improved. In the process of shopping, she and her husband notice the production of rubber bands as a new craft, and there is a demand for them in the market. With that thought, they decided to change direction of their business. With the money they have saved combined with a loan from TYM fund, they were able to purchase a rubber band cutting machine. Presently the business is doing very well, with average daily income of 12.00 USD. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 550.00 USD.

She sells children&apos;s clothing on the central market. She has spent all her money to purchase goods at the beginning of the season. Currently she needs to pay for rent and has decided to obtain a loan for 10 months. She will pay rent, which will allow her to work at her sales location for a long time without any issues. She has permanent clients that know where she is located and therefore it would be not to Maibonu&apos;s advantage to change locations. She has been in sales for the past 8 years. She is divorced and has 2 daughters. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Зикирова Майбону проживает в городе Яван. Работает на центральном рынке , где торгует одеждой для детей. С началом сезона все ее деньги ушли на приобретение товара. А в данный момент ей необходимо оплатить арендную плату , поэтому она решила получить кредит сроком на 10 месяцев. Она оплатит аренду и будет долгое время торговать на своей торговой точке без проблем. Кроме того у нее есть постоянные клиенты , которые знают ее постоянное место работы. И  поэтому менять его ей не выгодно. Занимается троговлей уже  8 лет. Она разведена и имеет двух дочек.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>192276</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Thi Nga is 44 years old, and joined TYM fund in 2006. She currently lives in a village that has a tradition of making baskets. Luckily both she and her husband are very skilled in making baskets. When first joining the fund, she borrowed 185.00 USD to buy materials for making baskets. In this business, they are able to use the labor of everyone in the family. Because of their skillfulness and years of experience in this trade, customers always place their orders ahead and thus her family did not have to spend time trying to sell the baskets. Their daily income from making the baskets is 9.00 USD. Her son works outside the home and makes about 92.00 USD per month. For this loan, her family wishes to borrow 550.00 USD to continue investment in their basket- making business.

Thi Duyen is 54 years old, retired military personnel with a stable monthly income. However, she is a hardworking woman and likes to stay active. In 2006 she joined TYM fund to borrow money for a breeding farm, and she chose to raise pigs. Because she is retired, she has a lot of time to invest in the family&apos;s pig breeding farm.  Her first year in the fund already brought good results right from the first loan. She decided to borrow a higher amount for her second loan,and also invested it in her pig farm. The income she made from her pig farm was used to purchase things for their daily lives, and to educate her children. She currently has 2 children in trade school. For this loan, she would like to borrow 550.00 USD to invest in her pig farm. Her average monthly income is 305.00 USD &#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Thu Ostrander, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chị Hoàng Thị Duyên 54 tuổi là cán bộ về hưu có lương tháng ổn định, nhưng bản thân chị là người phự nữ chịu khó lại luôn thích vân động.

Thi Bay, 35 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2006. Born in the rural area, she understands that she would face financial problems if her family only relied on farming. Right after she was married, she discussed with her husband to find a business that would stablise their family&apos;s economy, and they decided on selling pork. Everyday, her husband goes to the town market to buy pork which her sells at home whiL. Mrs. Bay then sells in the village market, bringing back a daily profit of 150,000VND (about 10USD). Since joining the Fund, her family has had more capital so their business has been even more smooth. Besides, she still has a source of income from farming and raising livestock. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550.00USD) to further invest in her business. Her family&apos;s average monthly income is 6,000,000VND (about 400USD).&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Chị Lê Thị Bảy 35 tuổi.

Thi Nhi, 44 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2007. Her first loan of 3,000,000VND (about 200USD) was used to invest in doing business and raising livestock.

She and her husband reside with her parents, along with 2 small children. Besides working in the field, the family’s main business is mat weaving.  She has been a member since 2005 and was able to obtain an initial loan of 3000 000d in which the family used to buy raw materials for mat making.  She was able to make a profit 2500 000d after this initial loan.  Mat making is not hard work; it’s able to bring a steady income for the family.  The loans she requested and received thereafter were used for her business and some of the money was invested in livestock as well.  The operation of her mat making business has gone smoothly now that the business is stable.   The family is able to produce 5 mats in a day and after all expenses, they are able to profit 150.000d from each mat.  This time she is requesting a loan of 9.000.000d to invest in buying raw materials for mat weaving.  Her family average income is 5.000.000d/month.

She has been a member since 2006, the home where her family reside sits on a main road and is a very ideal and convenient location for an auto part store.  She was able to borrow 3.000.000 on her first loan, which she used as capital to buy a variety of rubber rope products (timing belts) to sell out of her home; averaging 60.000d/day.  After seeing the success of her business, she was able to expand her business, offering products such as automobiles rims and tires.  This special inventory demands a higher capital; therefore she is requesting a larger loan amount.  The auto part business has been a success; in 2007 she was able to purchase a truck to help aid in transporting her inventory.  This time she is requesting a loan of 9.000.000d to use as principal for the new inventory.

After Ludmila had resigned from her last job she couldn&apos;t find a new job in her field for a while. Her family was facing a tough financial situation at the time, so she decided to take a risk and start her own small business. Today Ludmila runs a small kiosk selling shoes and clothing in the local market. Currently, she has 4 vending facilities in the same marketplace and about $16,000 invested in inventory.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ludmila is a determined entrepreneur. She has been in business for about 20 years. She knows how to set goals and achieve them. Ludmila recognizes that financial assistance from &quot;Nadiya Ukraine&quot; has provided significant support for her business and has promoted its stable growth. Ludmila is requesting a loan for 5000 Grivnas to increase her turnover capital, which will allow her to re-supply her inventory and increase her sales. Eventually, Ludmila Anna is hoping to rent a bigger vending facility and open her own little shoe store. She believes that financial assistance in combination with her zeal, perseverance and diligent work will someday help her dream come true.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1100</funded_amount><paid_amount>1100</paid_amount><image><id>192343</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase seasonal footwear and clothing</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Pavlograd</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>48.516667 35.866667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-22T16:10:13Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1100</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ludmila</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-06T00:48:10Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>UAH</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>5000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1100</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-05T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-05T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1666.66</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>366.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>366.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>366.66</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>367</amount><local_amount>1668.18</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-27T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-29T07:38:42Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1693.58</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>339070</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>366.34</amount><local_amount>1665.16</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-05T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-16T06:06:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1690.51</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5323179</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>366.66</amount><local_amount>1666.66</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-05T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-15T23:18:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1692.03</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9942510</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-23T00:48:10Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-01-15T23:18:45Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61240</id><name>Lyubov</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Lyubov is married.

Now she needs more capital to keep investing in her business and earn more.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Carmen asked for a loan from FAPE to invest in some men&apos;s and women&apos;s trousers, also in underwear and clothes for all the family.  She wants to have a better business, better earnings and to give her kids and her family a better quality of life.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer &lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Carmen hace dos años era una vendedora de ropa ambulante, vendía sus productos de casa en casa, empezó su negocio con poca mercadería principalmente blusas para mujeres.  Con el paso del tiempo sus ventas fueron creciendo y con las ganancias pudo invertir mas en su negocio, hace un año tuvo la idea de alquilar un local comercial, el cual esta situado en el Mercado de Villa Nueva.  Ahora ella necesita más capital para poder seguir invirtiendo en su negocio y tener más ganancias.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Por eso Carmen solicito un préstamo a FAPE, para poder invertir en comprar pantalones para hombre y mujer, también para ropa interior, y ropa para toda la familia...  Ella quiere tener un mejor negocio, tener mejores ingresos y así darles una mejor calidad de vida a sus hijas y su familia.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1100</funded_amount><paid_amount>1100</paid_amount><image><id>192396</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

El crédito anterior fue usado para mejoras de su hogar pero éste será usado en la mejora de su negocio, con el dinero solicitado comprará granos básicos y productos de limpieza para abastecer su negocio y satisfacer las demandas de sus vecinos del barrio.

What she likes about her store is that it generates a good income that is gradually increasing. What is difficult about the business is not having a booth to provide a better presentation of her products. Nelly works to pay for daily expenses and the education of her son.

Nelly atiende desde las 6 hasta las 10 de la mañana. Lo que le gusta de su negocio es que le genera buenos ingresos y crece poco  a poco. Lo más difícil es no tener un kiosco adecuado para dar una mejor presentación a sus productos.&#13;&#10;Nelly trabaja para los gastos diarios y la educación de su hijo.&#13;&#10;Con el dinero que solicita quiere mandar a construir su kiosco e implementarse con pescado selectos y así dar una buena atención a sus clientes.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>225</funded_amount><paid_amount>225</paid_amount><image><id>192435</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits &amp;

Erika works every day to create a better future for herself and to have a family in the future.

He used to work at his sister&apos;s grocery store, but two years ago he decided to start his own business in order to pay for his studies.  With his family&apos;s help, he set up public internet booths in his house.  He runs the internet cafe in the afternoon.  The best part about Julio Cesar&apos;s job is that it allows him to continue studying for a degree in civil engineering at the Juliaca city university, while at the same time earn money to cover the cost of school.  He likes to use the Internet to look up information or surf the Web.  The hardest part of the job is keeping the computers in good working order, since there are often problems with them.  Julio Cesar works hard every day to shape a better future for himself.  He plans to use the loan money to invest in the purchase of another computer.

Desde que se separó de su esposo - hace dos años - incursionó en la venta de Api (Bebida elaborada a base de maíz morado), negocio en que sale adelante gracias a la colaboración de sus dos pequeños niños, los cuales la apoyan incondicionalmente. La venta la realiza por las tardes, ya que por las mañanas se dedica a atender a sus hijos que van a la escuela.A Alidian siempre le ha gustado trabajar, le gusta mucho interactuar con la gente, ofreciendo su rico Api, pero a veces resulta difícil atenderlos a todos, ya que ella y sus niños no se abastecen para atender a toda la gente que concurre a su pequeño establecimiento.   &#13;&#10;Alidian trabaja duro y parejo para darles una profesión a sus hijos y que así puedan sostenerse cuando sean adultos.&#13;&#10;El dinero que solicita será invertido netamente en su para el crecimiento de su negocio y si le va bien contratar a alguien que la ayude en la atención.

Since she separated from her husband two years ago she began selling Api (drink produced from purple maize); she has been able to get ahead in this business thanks to the support of her two small children who unconditionally support it. She does the selling in the afternoons since in the mornings she devotes her time to her children who go to school.  Alidian has always liked to work, interact with people, and offer them her rich Api, but at the same time it is difficult for her (with the help of her children) to serve everyone who comes to her small business.  Alidian works hard to give her children the chance at a profession that will enable them to sustain themselves when they are older. The money that she asks for in a loan will be invested in her business and if all goes well she hopes to hire someone who can assist in sales. In the future Alidian hopes to have other branches of her business for the sale of Api in different areas of Juliaca.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>192499</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Increase her capital for her business.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Juliaca</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-15.5 -70.133333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2008-09-01T07:02:11Z</posted_date><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Alidian</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-15T18:07:56Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>59</amount><local_amount>168.57</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-15T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-16T07:12:10Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>173.37</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>361151</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>57.67</amount><local_amount>164.77</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T00:27:37Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>169.46</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5335769</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T01:22:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>171.42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9956947</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T14:05:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>171.42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10227197</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T20:05:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>171.42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20422439</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.34</amount><local_amount>166.65</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-15T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T20:36:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>171.38</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27115663</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-09-01T18:07:56Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-04-15T20:36:50Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61297</id><name>Edgar Eloy</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>Edgar tiene 22 años, vive en casa con su madre.

As a child he learned to machine weave textiles by watching his mother; now he uses his experience to create interesting models, weaving with much enthusiasm. Edgar works all week to make his garments and sells them on Saturday and Sunday in fairs throughout the city. Although it is strange for a man, Edgar enjoys weaving; however he often asks his mother for help as he has trouble creating combination of colors. With the money he is asking for as a loan, Edgar plans to invest in the purchase of another weaving machine as well as a variety of wool that will allow him to help increase their production and provide a better quality of life to his mother since she can no longer work as she did in her youth.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>192487</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Textiles</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Purchase

Ela has been doing this since she moved to the city of Juliaca, 7 years; she was born in a community on the outskirts of the city. She is still unmarried and enjoys her work, which allows her to help her mother; the most difficult part is splitting the wood, which requires significant physical effort.

She is considering investing her money so that she can purchase more firewood which would allow their business to be more productive and in the future they would be able to have another location and another business.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>192486</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fuel/Firewood</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Increase

Alejandrina works ever day for the sole purpose of giving her children a better life and allowing them to become professionals.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>192489</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Increase the amount of clothing she sells in order to increase her profits.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Juliaca</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-15.5 -70.133333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2008-09-01T07:02:13Z</posted_date><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Alejandrina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-15T19:31:04Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>59</amount><local_amount>168.57</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-15T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-16T07:12:11Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>173.37</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>361155</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>57.67</amount><local_amount>164.77</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T00:27:41Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>169.46</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5335774</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T01:21:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>171.42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9956952</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T14:05:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>171.42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10227202</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T20:05:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>171.42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20422444</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.34</amount><local_amount>166.65</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-15T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T20:36:42Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>171.38</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27115668</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-09-01T19:31:04Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-04-15T20:36:42Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61302</id><name>Alejandrina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>&lt;p&gt; Alejandrina is 42 years old, divorced, and now lives on her own.

She was not able to complete her education because she had to work to help her family&apos;s economic situation.   She&apos;s lived in the city of Juliaca for 17 years now, during which she&apos;s worked at different jobs.   But for the last 10 years, thanks to a lot of hard work,  she was able to open her own small shop in her house selling everyday grocery and household items.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Cristina likes her work in the shop as it allows her to work from home.   The difficult part is always having to stock more products to sell, as it&apos;s hard to predict how much she needs and it&apos;s expensive to overstock.   Cristina works hard to make sure her daughter has an education and can pursue a profession.

After losing her husband at a young age, she struggled to raise her children who now all have finished school and have grown.  She has been a member since 2006.  Her initial loan of 2.000.000d was used to purchase hogs in hope to support her family financially.  After seeing the success of her business, she became more confident and seeks more loans to help with her business.  The profits gained and loan she received thereafter was used to expand her business and she was even able to buy hens-to lay eggs.  At this present time, her livestock consists of 7 pigs and 200 hens.  Her daily income is about 200.000d.  Three of her five children are grown and are living on their own.  The other 2 children reside with her and both have steady jobs with a 3.000.000d/month income.  This time she is requesting a loan of 6.000.000 to invest in farm animals.  Her average income is 5.000.000d/month. &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Lynn Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Chị Nguyễn Thị Huệ 55 tuổi.

He is a farmer who cultivates twice a year. In the rainy season, Mr. Chea K. grows rice, while he grows vegetables in the dry season. On his plantation, Mr. Chea K. now faces a small problem because he does not have enough money to purchase fertilizer to support the rice field. Thus, he decided to ask for a loan for this purpose, and he would use part of the loan to buy pesticide to kill insects in order to make his crop more productive. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Chea K. is a widower with eight children, one of whom is working as a construction worker while six others are attending school.

Before joining TYM fund, her family was going through difficult time: big family, her children did not have stable jobs so they could not help her much. In 2007, she joined TYM fund. Her first loan was for 2.000.000 VND. She bought 2 calves, kept them for a year then sold them for 3.000.000 VND. Then with the money from the sale, she invested in raising pigs &amp; ducks. Currently she has 2 breeding cows, 8 pigs and a paddle of 200 egg laying ducks. Now her family annual income is 50.000.000 VND. Her children are all grown up and hold a stable job, their income is 4.000.000 VND a month. This time she is requesting a loan of 7.000.000 to invest more in her pig &amp; duck business. Her family monthly income is 6.000.000 VND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva

She built new pig pen and expanded the operation. This has been a success. Things have changed for the better. Her family financial situation has improved a lot.

Thi Huong, 42 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2003. She borrowed the first loan of 2,000,000VND (125USD) to invest in her small general store in the market. Her daily income from this is about 100,000VND (6.25USD). Since joining the Fund, the income from this business has been higher. Besides the store, she also invests in rearing pigs. This is also the main source of income for her family, as every year she can sell 3 rounds of pigs, each round 3 tonnes, yielding a profit of about 35,000,000VND (2187.50USD). This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to continue investing in rearing pigs. Her average monthly income is 5,000,000VND (312.50USD).&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Chị Vũ Thi Hương 42 tuổi, Tham gia vào Quỹ năm 2003.

Thi Ly, 40 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2007 with the goal of improving her family&apos;s financial situation. Her first loan of 5,000,000VND (312.50USD) was used to invest in rearing pigs. Realizing the high profit gained, her family decided to renovate the pig sty to continue rearing pigs in a large scale. Since then, her family members have been putting more effort into work. Her husband also works as a construction worker with the monthly income of 2,000,000VND (125USD). Mrs. Ly sometimes works as cleaner for the village&apos;s administration house for the monthly income of 1,000,000VND (62.50USD). With these stable incomes, her family has always been able to repay the loan fully. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to invest in rearing pigs. Her family&apos;s average monthly income is 4,000,000VND (250USD).&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Chị Vũ Thị Lý 40 tuổi, tham gia Quỹ năm 2007 với mục đích vay vốn phát triển kinh tế. Vòng vốn đầu tiên gia đình chị vay 5000.000đ đầu tư vào chăn nuôi lợn, sau 1 vòng vốn vay thấy rằng việc chăn nuôi sẽ đem lại hiệu quả kinh tế, gia đình chị đã bàn bạc sửa chữa lại toàn bộ chuồng trại để tiếp tục đầu tư vào chăn nuôi với mô hình lớn hơn. Từ khi tham gia vốn các thành viên trong gia đình đều cố gắng hơn trong công việc, chồng chị làm nghề thợ xây nên công việc của anh cũng rất đều đặn thu nhập bình quân hàng tháng 2.000.000đ, chị làm vệ sinh môi trường tại ủy ban xã công việc tranh thủ nhưng lương mỗi tháng 1.000.000đ. Với thu nhập ổn định như vậy nên việc hoàn trả vốn của gia đình luôn hoàn thành tốt.

Ezhar is uneducated, but clever and active. During the last three decades, because of the war in Afghanistan, Ezhar couldn&apos;t go to school and was unable to realize his dreams. His two small brothers are studying in a public school and Ezhar helps them and attempts to provide all the necessary things for them.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;When Ezhar A. got married, his father gave him just 30,000 Afghanis ($600). He was tired of farming, so he changed his business and immediately opened a small retail shop with 18,000 Afghanis and purchased some goods with the remainin money. At the beginning,  Ezhar encountered some difficulties because he was new to this business and didn&apos;t have previous experience in shopkeeping. He didn&apos;t know how to find customers and increase his sales, but after a few months he got this skill and was finally able to purchase more retail goods for his shop.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ezhar A. is not just a breadwinner for his own family, but he must provide some medicines for his sick parents and support his small brothers also.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two months ago he completed a mobile phone repair private course, and then he decided to change his business and started a mobile repair and sales shop. He thinks that there is much demand for these things, but he needs some money to purchase enough equipment and different models of mobile phones. Thereford he has applied to AFSG for a 50,000 Afghanis loan for 18 months.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ezhar dreams that if he able to increase his daily income from 400 Afghanis ($8) to 700 Afghanis ( $14), he will learn some English and computer skills. He sincerely thanks the lenders who assist poor people hard times and encourage them to work.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1075</funded_amount><paid_amount>1075</paid_amount><image><id>192553</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Phone

Gradually, Gulnora&apos;s business has expanded. Because she is hard-working and polite by nature, she has managed to obtain a devoted clientel that is happy with the goods and services she provides, and her business generates a stable income for the family. Gulnora loves her children very much and wants all of them to be well-educated. This year her daughter finished secondary school, and Gulnora wants her to enter university. To be able to do that, Gulnora has applied for a loan of $600, which she will pay back in 12 months. She will use the loan to buy additional clothing and increase the range of items she has for sale.

For 19 years, she has worked as a vendor, selling popular plates and dishes from China in the central local market. These items widely prized for dowries and as gifts on special occasions. Because Sharofat loves her children deeply, she makes every effort possible to provide them with what they need. To increase her income and her ability to provide for them, Sharofat wants to enlarge the range of goods she has for sale, and to purchase china from the neighboring countries of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. To make this possible, she has applied for a loan of $1,000 for a term of 12 months. Sharofat has been an active and strongly motivated client of IMON since 2007. Her credit history makes her eligible to receive new and larger loans. The well being of Sharofat’s family and her business are in your hands, and she and her children are sincerely grateful for your support.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>192567</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home

When he found AFSG in Kabul and he learned about this process of small loans, then he requested an individual loan of 50000 Afghani with a term of 18  months to buy a new generator so that he can work hard and keep his business going.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He is happy with this process of small loans in this poor country. This loan can change a lot in the life of every worker.  Abdul Khalaq says that that he has worked in this business for 12 years and still he couldn&apos;t expand his business.

Sayaad Shah is a very hard worker. He always wants to become strong in his business. He loves his business.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Shah wants to enlarge his business so he has requested an individual loan to complete his stock and buy more to sell such as baskets, shampoo, and Pepsi, to attract more customers and make a good monthly income for his family.

This is 35-year-old Debora Leonard. She is married and has three children ages two, seven, and thirteen. In 2005, Debora established her small grocery shack (or genge) business. Working six days a week, and  nine to twelve hours a day, she earns about 30 USD every month from this business. Debora requires a loan in order to purchase more sugar, salt, cooking oil and home appliances in bulk. In the future, Debora plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support.  &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is &quot;genge.&quot; A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chiles, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people usually send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and discover they are short an ingredient or two.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192573</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase more sugar, salt, cooking oil and home appliances in bulk</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-30T19:10:31Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Debora S.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-13T20:13:27Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:17:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>356204</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347946</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:09:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970520</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:13:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886737</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:02:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20435997</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-30T20:13:27Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:02:33Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61334</id><name>Barubina N.</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Mbeya, Tanzania!

The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192577</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase more sugar, rice, soap, cooking oil in bulk.</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-30T19:00:41Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Mary M.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-13T20:24:07Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:17:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>356207</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:42Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347949</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:09:15Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970523</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:13:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886740</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:02:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436000</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-30T20:24:07Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:02:25Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61338</id><name>Apaikunda&apos;s Hekima Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Apaikunda  is 41 years old.

Thi Hoan, 39 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2007. Her family relies mainly on agriculture and their income falls into the average range. Mrs. Hoan has 4 schooling children. Her first loan of  5,000,000VND (312.50USD) was used to invest in rearing pigs. She always took the time and money to purchase more bran and corn to feed the pigs, so after the first loan she sold the pigs and gained a profit of 8,000,000VND (about 500USD). She continued to use this profit to purchase pigs and pig feeds. Her husband is a construction worker with the monthly income of 2,000,000VND (about 125USD). This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to continue investing in rearing pigs.

R.</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Mbeya, Tanzania! This is 23-year-old Ikupa M.. She is married and has one child, aged nine months. In 2007, Ikupa established her clothes business. She opens her business six days a week and  nine to twelve hours a day. Ikupa requires a loan in order to purchase more clothes in bulk. In the future, Ikupa plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially among the younger generation, because they are so cheap and because of the general appeal of anything western or modern. Many people argue that the popularity of the West’s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress; however, the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192581</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To purchase more clothes in bulk.</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-30T19:00:42Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ikupa R.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-13T20:38:04Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:17:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>356208</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:42Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347950</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:09:18Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970524</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:13:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886741</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:02:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436001</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-30T20:38:04Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:02:26Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61341</id><name>Thi Truc</name><description><languages type="list"><language>vi</language></languages><texts><vi>Mrs. N. Thi Truc, 45 years old, has 5 children, 2 of whom are already married. Like many other rural families, her family relies mainly on agriculture. In 2003, she joined the TYM Fund and borrowed the first loan of 2.000.000VND (about 125USD) to invest in breeding ducks. Since then, her family&apos;s financial situation has improved and the quality of life has been better. Besides breeding ducks, she also used the subsequent loans to rear pigs. Currently, she has 7 pigs, 200 breeding ducks, each year yielding a high profit. Her children are all working and having stable monthly income of 3.000.000VND (about 187.50USD). This time round, she would like to borrow 8.000.000VND (500USD) to purchase fruit tree saplings and fertilizers.

This is thirty-year-old Happy S.. She is married and has one child, aged fourteen. She also has two dependents who live with her because they are orphans. In 2002, Happy established her rice selling business. Working six days a week, and  nine to twelve hours a day, she earns about 100 USD every month from this business. She is assisted by her husband. Happy requires a loan in order to purchase more rice in bulk. In the future, Happy plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192583</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase rice in bulk</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-30T18:50:55Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Happy S.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-13T19:43:05Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:17:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>356209</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347951</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:09:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970525</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:13:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886742</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:02:28Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436002</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-30T19:43:05Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:02:28Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61343</id><name>Hoang Thi</name><description><languages type="list"><language>vi</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><vi>Tham gia quỹ năm 1998, chị Hoàng Thị Hồng 37 tuổi điều kiện kinh tế trước khi trưa tham gia Quỹ ở mức trung bình, chồng chị làm nghề thợ xây nên ngoài làm ruộng ra anh còn đi làm thu nhập cũng ổn định 2.000.000đ/ tháng, chị có hai người con đang còn nhỏ đang trong độ tuổi ăn học.

Before joining TYM, the financial situation of the family was not good. Her husband is farmer as well as a construction worker, earning 2.000.000 VND per month. They have two children, both of whom are still in school. For the past 10 years, Mrs. H. has been using all the loans to invest in breeding poultries. In the first round, Mrs. H. took out only 500.000 VND to raise pigs. After that, Mrs. H. has borrowed more loans to expand her business and renovate her house. As a very industrious woman, Mrs. H. is also a porter besides raising poultries at home, from which she earns about 2.000.000 VND per month. In the next round of loan, she would like to borrow 12.000.000 VND ($725) to renovate the breeding facilities and buy buffaloes. Her family’s monthly income is 6.000.000 VND &lt;a&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva

This is 24-year-old Bupe N.. She is married and has three children aged one, three, and six. In 2006, Bupe established her butchery business. Working six days a week and 13 to 16 hours a day, she earns about 120 USD every month. She is assisted by her husband in the shop. Bupe requires a loan in order to expand and renovate her business. In the future, Bupe plans to open another business. She thanks you for your support.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192587</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Butcher Shop</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To expand and renovate her business</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-30T18:50:58Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Bupe I.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-13T20:21:33Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:17:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>356210</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347952</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:09:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970526</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:13:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886743</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:02:29Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436003</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-30T20:21:33Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:02:29Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61345</id><name>Nguyen Thi</name><description><languages type="list"><language>vi</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><vi>Chị Nguyễn Thị Văn 32 tuổi, nghề nghiệp chính của gia đình chị là làm ruộng, ngoài ra gia đình chị còn làm nghề phụ đóng gạch táp lô bán.

But after that, Mrs. V. used the loans to buy and sell bricks. As the demand for building materials is enormous these days, Mrs. V.’s business has been very profitable.

L.</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Mbeya, Tanzania! This is 26-year-old Bahati K.. She is married and has two children aged 6 and 8. She has two dependents, who live with her because they are orphans. In 2007, Bahati established her kuku (chicken) ranching business. She is open for business six days a week and five to eight hours a day. She is assisted by her husband. Bahati requires a loan in order to purchase more kuku (50). In the future, Bahati plans to expand and establish another business. She thanks you for your support.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. (In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku.) For the rest of you... who or what are &quot;kuku,&quot; you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons: they require little start-up capital, require little space, and while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. There are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192589</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Poultry</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To purchase more kuku (chickens)</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-30T18:50:58Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Bahati L.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-13T20:07:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:17:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>356211</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347953</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:09:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970527</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:13:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886744</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:02:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436004</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-30T20:07:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:02:31Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61347</id><name>Mage M.</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Mbeya, Tanzania!

Raising cows has been very profitable for the family as people in her neighborhood and adjacent areas regularly buy them. Mrs. C. and her husband have four children, all of whom are married and live independently. In the next round of loan, Mrs. C. would like to borrow 10.000.000 VND ($625) to buy more cows.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192593</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase rice in bulk</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-30T18:40:40Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Tutindaga N.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-13T19:44:48Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:17:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>356214</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347956</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:09:07Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970530</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:13:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886747</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:02:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436007</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-30T19:44:48Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:02:24Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61351</id><name>Nguyen Thi</name><description><languages type="list"><language>vi</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><vi>Chị Nguyễn Thị N. 45 tuổi.

She is currently the supplier of ducks’ eggs for people in her neighborhood and adjacent areas. The business helps Mrs. N. earn about 4.000.000 VND per month. Her two grown-up children make about 3.000.000 VND per month. In the next round of loan, Mrs. N. would like to borrow 15.000.000 VND ($925) to buy more ducks. Her family’s monthly income is 7.000.000 VND. &lt;a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva

Mrs. H.’s husband is not only a farmer but also a construction worker, earning about 2.000.000 VND per month. The family’s financial situation is relatively good compared to that of other families in her neighborhood. When TYM Fund opened its branch in her area, Mrs. H. didn’t hesitate to participate in the program and request loans. Because the loan of the first round was limited, Mrs. H. could only take out 500000 VND and used it to breed chickens. As the amount of loans that can be borrowed increases annually, Mrs. H. has used them to raise pigs and cows. The family’s situation has been improved a lot as a result, which allows the family to purchase necessary furniture for their house. Her two children who are working make 3.000.000 VND per month, which helps the whole family a lot. In the next round of loan, Mrs. H. would like to borrow 11.000.000 VND ($ 675) to keep investing in poultries.

This is 37-year-old Maria M..  She is married and has four children. She also has two dependents who live with her because they are disabled.  In 2007, Maria established her retail shop. Working seven days a week, and  9 - 12 hours a day, she earns about US$ 100 every month from this business. She is assisted by her elder sister. Maria requires a loan in order to purchase home needs items. She thanks you for your support.  &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The Swahili word for this type of outside shop or stall is genge. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people usually send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don&apos;t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing

She had a harder life than most women, and her family&apos;s happiness was short-lived. She and her husband had encountered too many contradictions trying to build their lives together, so they parted ways. She decided not to remarry and stayed single taking care of her child. She joined the fund in 1997 and borrowed money to invest in raising pigs. After raising pigs she was able to make enough money and bought a water buffalo to use in her farming business. Now she wants to invest in raising sows. Her child is now grown and working, making average 93 USD per month. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 625 USD to invest in her sow raising business.

This is 45-year-old Stenala E..  She is married and has one child, aged 3. She has one dependent who lives with her because he is an orphan. In 1993, Stenala established her banana-selling business. Working seven days a week, and one to four hours a day, she earns about US $10 every month from this business. Stenala requires a loan in order to buy more bananas in bulk. She thanks you for your support.  &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;SELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment Ð a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>192599</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits &amp; Vegetables</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To buy more bananas in bulk</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-20T18:20:18Z</posted_date><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Stenala S.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-03T19:26:04Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>300000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-03T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-15T07:16:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>63690</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>346860</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:47Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>63690</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347959</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:06:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>63690</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970533</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:10:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>63690</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886750</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:00:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>63690</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436010</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-20T19:26:04Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:00:49Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61357</id><name>Huong</name><description><languages type="list"><language>vi</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><vi>Chị Đặng Thị Hường 32 tuổi, ngày từ thời con gái chị đã được bố mẹ cho đi học nghề may để sau này đỡ vất vả, khi chị đi lấy chồng chị vẫn tiếp tục làm nghề may nhưng do thiếu vốn nên công việc may của chị không được đều đặn.

When she was younger, her parents let her go to sewing school so that she would not have a hard life. After getting married, she continued with her sewing business, but due to lack of money the income from her sewing business was not regular. In 2000 she joined the fund after discussing with her husband in order to borrow money to purchase fabrics. With the loan, she was able to  buy a lot of fabrics, and combined with her experience, her business expanded bringing in more customers. In addition to rice farming, her husband also does carpentry/construction work, and makes average of 120 USD per month, which makes their family income more stable. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 425 USD to purchase fabrics.

This is 25-year-old Kiba M..  She is married and has two children aged 2 and 9. She has two dependents who live with her because they are orphans.  In 2005, Kiba established her genge business. Working six days a week, and nine to twelve hours a day, she earns about US $40 every month from this business. She is assisted by her husband. Kiba requires a loan in order to buy more home needs in bulk.

A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people usually send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don&apos;t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192601</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To buy more basic staples in bulk</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-20T18:20:20Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Kiba A.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-03T20:07:59Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-03T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-15T07:16:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>346861</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:48Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347960</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:06:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970534</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:10:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886751</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:00:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436011</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-20T20:07:59Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:00:53Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61359</id><name>Yen</name><description><languages type="list"><language>vi</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><vi>Chị Nguyễn Thị Yến 38 tuổi, điều kiện kinh tế gia đình chị thuộc hộ khá ở địa phương, ngoài làm ruộng ra chị làm nghề hàng xáo và xay xát lúa gạo.

Her husband is currently working in the States under one labor export program. Mrs. L. only borrowed 2.000.000 VND in the first round of loan to invest in tailoring. As Mrs. L. is a skilled tailor, her shop is very popular in her area. Realizing that she still had time to do something else besides tailoring, Mrs. L. started using the loans from TYM Fund to open a small shop selling a variety of necessities at home in 2003. This has helped her family make about 3.000.000 VND per month. Her husband sends money back home every month to help the whole family. In the next round of loan, Mrs. L. would like to borrow 10.000.000 VND ($625) to purchase more goods for her shop. Her family’s monthly income is 5.000.000 VND. &lt;a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva

These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because they are so cheap and because of the general appeal of anything western or modern. Many people argue that the popularity of the West&apos;s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress, however the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192616</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used Clothing</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To buy additional clothes for re-sale</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-20T23:20:16Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Vumilia S.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-04T13:02:03Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-04T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-04T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-04T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-04T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-04T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-15T07:16:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>347895</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-04T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347966</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-04T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:06:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970540</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-04T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:12:10Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886757</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-04T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:01:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436017</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-21T13:02:03Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:01:17Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61371</id><name>Mahkamtosh</name><description><languages type="list"><language>ru</language></languages><texts><ru>Mahkamtosh S. lives in the Vakhsh region.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment Ð a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192618</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Knitting</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>To renovate her business </use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-20T23:20:16Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Aisha S.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-04T02:30:36Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-04T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-17T07:21:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>347896</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347967</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:05:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970541</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:10:03Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886758</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:00:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436018</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-21T02:30:36Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:00:50Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61373</id><name>Mahmadsaid</name><description><languages type="list"><language>ru</language></languages><texts><ru>Mahmadsaid G. lives in the Khourson region.

Her family’s occupations are farming and raising poultries (chickens, ducks and fishes). She has three children, two of whom are working while the other is still in school. In the first round of loan, Mrs. T. took out 2.000.000 VND to raise fishes and plant rice. Mrs. T. then used the loans of the next rounds to raise ducks and expand her ranch. This has generated a lot of profits for the family. Mrs. T. currently has 8 ponds to raise fishes, 300 ducks for eggs and 400 ducks for meat. The profits from raising ducks for eggs are about 300000 VND per day. Her two children who are working have an income of 3.000.000 VND per month. In the next round of loan, she would like to borrow 10.000.000 VND ($625) to purchase food for poultries.

The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192624</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cloth &amp; Dressmaking Supplies</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To buy more clothes in bulk.</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-30T18:30:48Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ema E.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-13T18:57:18Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:17:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>356216</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347969</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:09:20Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970543</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:13:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886760</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:02:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436020</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-30T18:57:18Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:02:31Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61379</id><name>Nguyen Thi</name><description><languages type="list"><language>vi</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><vi>Chị Nguyễn Thị Lâm 35 tuổi, chồng chị làm nghề xây dựng công việc của anh rất ổn định cho thu nhập hàng tháng là 2.000.000đ, gia đình chị có vườn rộng nên chị đầu tư chồng các loại rau ngoài ra chị còn làm thêm nghề hàng xáo.

This is 32-year-old Kristina  M.. She is married and has three children aged six, nine and 12. In 2001, Kristina established her crops-selling business. Kristina requires a loan in order to buy more crops in bulk. She thanks you for your support.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>192627</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To buy crops in bulk</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-30T18:30:48Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Kristina P.</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-13T19:56:46Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>90</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:17:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>356217</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347970</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:09:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970544</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:13:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886761</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:02:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104220</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436021</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-30T19:56:46Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:02:34Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61382</id><name>Dilbar</name><description><languages type="list"><language>ru</language></languages><texts><ru>Dilbar M. lives in the Djalollidini Rumi region of Tajikistan.

Nansubuga’S Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Hanifa is a leader of a 5-member group. She is a 34-year-old woman who is divorced with 4 children. They are aged between 16 and 4 years. They are all in school. She rents a two-room house in which she lives with six people. There is piped water and electricity. She resides and works in a semi-urban and slum area in the outskirts of Kampala.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Hanifa works seven days a week in Owino market in the center of Kampala. It&apos;s one of the biggest markets downtown where she rents a space to sell second-hand men’s trousers, a trade she has handled for over 2 years. She started with second-hand shoes. She buys them from wholesale shops and uses porters to carry the bales on their heads to Owino market. There is a market for her merchandise, and she serves both men and women wholesale and retail.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her main challenge is the rainy season, which makes storage of her trousers difficult because the stores fill with water. This also complicates movement to and from her stall as the ground is always covered with mud, thus reducing profits in this season. There is a risk of buying a bale full of substandard clothes, which are rejected, thus lowering profits. She sometimes fails to get proceeds for the goods that she sells on credit, due to lack of integrity on the part of her clients.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;After being with MCDT for 4 years and repaying 8 loans, Hanifa boasts of improved standards of living like providing her family with 3 meals a day and expanded business and income. Her major aspiration is seeing her business grow bigger so that she earns more profits.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1450</funded_amount><paid_amount>1450</paid_amount><image><id>192635</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used

Since her second business is going well, she wants to expand it, so she decided to ask for a loan to buy two more cows which cost KHR 1,000,000 ($250) each for breeding.

Kakooza’S Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mariam has been operating this business for the last 4 years. She works six days a week and operates a salon and beauty shop. She buys her merchandise twice a week from the Kampala city centre and uses public transport back to her shop. Mariam rents the shop where she operates her business and sells on both a retail and wholesale basis. Her customers are women in her community and those on the move. She works on 3-4 customers daily. Her challenges include: high rental charges, transport costs, thieves who usually break into her shop, and flooding during the rainy season. The area where she is operating is prone to floods, and this destroys her merchandise.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She was inspired to join MCDT because it was dealing with the active poor. She caters to customers who were previously moving long distances looking for salons and cosmetics. She has been with MCDT for the last 3 years and is servicing her seventh loan. She has been able to improve her standards of living by getting three meals daily and also taking her children to good schools. Her main inspiration is owning a permanent commercial house where she will be operating and also seeing her business progressing.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mariam is a leader of a 5-member group. She is 38 years old and married with 5 children. They are aged between 18 and 10 years, and they are all in school. Mariam owns a five-room house in which she lives with 7 people. She also takes care of two orphans of her late brother. There is no piped water, but she has electricity. She resides and works in a semi-urban and slum area in the outskirts of Kampala.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>192643</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Beauty Salon</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To invest in her inventory</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Kampala</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.315556 32.565556</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>112</partner_id><posted_date>2008-09-03T14:40:22Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Mariam</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Specioza</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Janepher</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Nuluyat</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Kevin</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-17T16:02:49Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>UGX</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1900000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-17T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>475000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-17T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>475000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-17T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>475000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-17T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>475000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>300</amount><local_amount>475000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-17T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-23T07:09:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>482700</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>363874</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>300</amount><local_amount>475000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-17T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-21T20:06:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>482700</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5334466</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>300</amount><local_amount>475000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-17T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-30T08:52:28Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>482700</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9955658</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>300</amount><local_amount>475000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-17T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-18T08:53:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>482700</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14876028</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-09-03T16:02:49Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-02-18T08:53:53Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61396</id><name>Doem</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mr. Doem C. is a bread seller in Preak Pe Village in Kandal Province.

She has been living in this city for the last 30 years. Azizan baji is the mother of seven children: four sons and three daughters. Her husband makes cloth from his power loom machines and sells them in the market and earns a good profit. Azizan baji is a housewife and also sells thread to different areas. She owes a two-room brick house. She successfully completed her two loans from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now she is applying for a loan to buy oil to save their power looms machine from rust. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is joined in her loan group by a few more members. Tasleem baji, Bushra baji, and Hajira baji each want a loan to buy thread to resell. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another&apos;s loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>192645</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Weaving</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>To

She is a farmer who cultivates twice a year in the field which located in Pro Theat Village in Kandal Province. Although Mrs. Sruy I. tries to cultivate twice a year, she still has a little revenue, so she now wants to expand it. Thus, Mrs. Sruy I. decided to ask for a loan to buy a piece of land in order to cultivate rice and vegetables. Her husband, Mr. Yoen ThI., is a laborer who can make a small income to support his family. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Sruy I. is 38 years old and the mother of five children. One of her children is employed in a garment factory while three more are attending school. The remaining one is too young to work or study. Her husband is shown in the picture because Mrs. Sruy I. is very busy with her work.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>192646</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

She buys her merchandise from Kampala city centre. She buys all types of goods from both retail and wholesale and uses public transport to transport her merchandise from Kampala to her salon/shop in Bwaise. She makes the trip twice a week. Her customers are women in her community and those on the move.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her challenges include paying high taxes, high rental charges, and transport costs. Flooding is a problem during the rainy season as the area where she is operating is prone to floods, which destroys her merchandise. It was once a wetland. Another challenge is that of her business being seasonal. During periods when there is low demand for salons, she switches to selling cereals and legumes, mainly dried beans. She has been operating this business for the last 10 years and was inspired by the way women were moving long distances looking for salons. She has been able to improve her standards of living, provide her family with three meals daily. Her main inspiration is owning a permanent home to operate from and also seeing her business progressing.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Beatrice is the leader of a 4-member group. She is 28 years old and married with 2 children. They are 7 and 2 years old. The one aged seven years is in school. She rents a three-room house in which she lives with 5 people. There is no piped water and electricity. She resides and works in a semi-urban and slum area, which is in the outskirts of Kampala.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>192648</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Tanzania! Rehema S. is a twenty-eight-year-old married woman from Dar es Salaam. Rehema owns and operates a small stall, which she established six months ago, from which she sells roasted fish. She buys fresh fish daily from local fishermen as they come in with their morning catch. Rehema roasts and sells these fish either in the fish market or along the roads of Dar. Given its location along the Indian Ocean, fish is plentiful in the waters around Dar es Salaam and is a staple of the local Tanzanian diet. Rehema is an enterprising micro-entrepreneur who is taking advantage of a local need to make monthly profits of 120 USD. She is currently requesting a loan of 225 USD in order to purchase fish in larger quantities. In the future, Rehema plans to open another stall to sell her delectable treats.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>225</funded_amount><paid_amount>225</paid_amount><image><id>192685</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fish

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Tanzania! Nessy N. is thirty-two years old. She is married with a two-year-old child. She also takes care of two other dependents who live with her because they attend school in the area. Earlier this year, Nessy opened a small shop from which she sells African traditional cloth. Local Tanzanian women purchase cloth from Nessy’s shop and use it to make vitenge, the traditional dress worn by Tanzanian women. Nessy runs the store with one employee and earns about 100 USD in profit each month. Nessy is requesting a loan of 275 USD in order to purchase additional stock of African traditional cloth in bulk. Nessy expects to earn about 200 USD from increased sales after getting this loan. In the future she hopes to increase the quantity and range of the business.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>192690</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To purchase additional stocks of traditional African cloth in bulk.</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Dar es Salaam</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-6.8 39.283333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-30T18:20:41Z</posted_date><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Nessy</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-13T19:17:20Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>300000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:17:57Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>63690</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>356219</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:18:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>63690</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347972</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T03:09:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>63690</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9970546</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T15:13:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>63690</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14886763</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T21:02:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>63690</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20436023</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-30T19:17:20Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T21:02:25Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61427</id><name>Moussa</name><description><languages type="list"><language>fr</language></languages><texts><fr>Moussa N. is a young disabled man who was born in 1982 in Thiès.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Tanzania! Selina Y. is thirty years old and is married with two children aged four and 11. She also supports an additional dependent who lives with her because this young girl’s parents cannot take care of her. Selina owns a shop where she sells rice, sugar, beans, wheat flour and maize flour. She is assisted by her husband and an employee in running her business. Selina earns about 600 USD from this business monthly. Selina is requesting a loan of 525 USD in order to purchase additional stocks of rice, sugar, beans and wheat flour. In the future, Selina plans to open another business.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>525</funded_amount><paid_amount>525</paid_amount><image><id>192696</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

She started working as a market vendor 6 years ago. Today she runs her own business selling men’s suits in the central city market. Presently, Svetlana has about $4000 of working capital. Her monthly profit amounts to $600. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;There are very few other businesses selling similar items in the market where Svetlana has her kiosk. Because of this, customer demand continues to grow all the time. Svetlana has established a reputation as an entrepreneur of integrity. She has repaid every loan she has received from Nadiya Ukraine without any defaults. Svetlana is requesting a loan for 3000 Grivnas to re-stock her inventory before the fall season.

Latifa R. was born thirty-five years ago; she&apos;s married with two children, ages 10 and 16. In 2005, Latifa established her poultry business (kuku) which enables her to earn a monthly profit of 500 USD. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Who or what are &quot;kuku,&quot; you may ask. Kuku means &quot;chickens&quot; in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. They require little start-up capital: you can start with two and wait for them to multiply naturally! They also require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Latifa is requesting the loan of 875 USD in order to purchase 400 chicks and additional feed. In the future, Latifa plans to buy even more chicks and expand her business further!&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>875</funded_amount><paid_amount>875</paid_amount><image><id>192703</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Poultry</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Tanzania! Sifa J. is from Dar es Salaam. She is married and has three children between the ages of four and 12. Sifa has been running a Mama Lishe or local café since 2005, from which she earns a monthly profit of 500 USD. Sifa is assisted by one employee and her husband in running the business. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is &quot;restaurant&quot; or &quot;café,&quot; you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or café in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don’t even appear in the Lonely Planet’s budget guide, but if you’re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. Sifa is requesting a loan of 275 USD in order to purchase additional stocks of rice, sugar, maize flour, wheat flour and cooking oil.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>192710</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cafe</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

Currently, Rosmeri is a seamstress who makes clothes using a knitting machine.  She has always liked to work, and has been doing it for two years.  She has a knitting machine in her home, which she uses to make hats, sweaters, pants, etc.  She offers her goods for sale at the markets in the city of Juliaca.  Her work is very well-received among the area’s residents.  What she enjoys most is her knitting, an art she’s been inclined toward since she was a young girl.  The most difficult aspect of her work is finishing her clothing on time, given that many of the items require a great deal of effort and she works alone. Rosmeri would like to start a family, for whom she wants to be able to offer a stable financial future.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With the money she is asking for, she will purchase more raw materials for making clothing and – if possible – another machine so someone can help her with her work.  In the future, Rosmeri would like to have a small general store. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rosmeri tiene 29 años, vive con su hermana L., quien se dedica a la venta de cerámica.&#13;&#10;Actualmente, Rosmeri se dedica al tejido a máquina de prendas de vestir, a ella siempre le ha gustado trabajar y lo viene haciendo desde hace ya doce años atrás.En su casa, ella posee una máquina de tejer, en la cual elabora diferentes tipos de prendas entre gorritos, chompas, pantalones, etc. que ofrece en los mercados de la ciudad de Juliaca, los cuales tienen gran acogida dentro de la población.Lo que más le gusta de su trabajo es el tejer, ya que desde niña siempre tuvo inclinación ante este arte, lo más difícil de su trabajo es terminar a tiempo las prendas que venderá, ya que en muchos casos la elaboración demora un poco ya que lo hace sola. Rosmeri quiere formar una familia, a la cual poder ofrecerle un buen futuro económico.&#13;&#10;Con el dinero que solicita comprara más materia prima para la producción de sus prendas y si es posible otra máquina, para que alguien la ayude en el trabajo, en el futuro Rosmeri quisiera tener una pequeña tienda de abarrotes.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>192715</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Textiles</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Purchase of raw materials (yarn) and another knitting machine.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Juliaca</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-15.5 -70.133333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-20T15:40:11Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Rosmeri</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-09-04T00:00:14Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>3530</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>588.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>588.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>588.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>588.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>588.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>588.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>588.33</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-04T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-05T07:13:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>589</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>347728</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>588.33</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T00:28:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>589</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5335778</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>588.33</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T01:14:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>589</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9956956</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>588.33</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T14:01:18Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>589</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10227206</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>588.33</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T20:01:47Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>589</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20422448</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>588.35</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-03T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T20:31:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>589</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27115672</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-08-21T00:00:14Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-04-15T20:31:46Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>61438</id><name>Gloria</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Tanzania! Gloria M. lives in Dar es Salaam where she owns a Mama Lishe (local cafe) that she established in 2004. She is assisted by three employees in the running of her café and earns monthly profit of about 300 USD. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is &quot;restaurant&quot; or &quot;café,&quot; you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or café in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don’t even appear in the Lonely Planet’s budget guide, but if you’re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. Gloria is requesting a loan of 800 USD in order to purchase a microwave and to make renovations to her café. Gloria hopes that her larger café will be able to hold more customers and thus enable her to expand her business and earn increased profits in the near future.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>192716</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

Yanet was born in the Pusi district, but has lived in the city of Juliaca for four years now.   She did not finish her education given that she had to start work at a young age to help out her family financially.  Yanet has dedicated herself to a number of occupations which is how, two years ago, she began selling clothing door-to-door throughout Juliaca.  She enjoys this business because the clothing is much sought-after by local residents.  The most difficult part is moving her merchandise around to sell.  Thanks to God, she counts on the support of her children who are always close to help her with her daily sales which she carries out all day.  Yanet had to help her children get ahead single-handedly, and wants to bring them better opportunities as they grow and become men and women.  With the money from her loan, she thinks she will purchase more merchandise so she can in that way increase her income.  In addition, she would like to open a clothing store so she can feel successful as a person and to provide a better quality of life for her children.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Yanet tiene 33 años, es madre soltera, vive con sus cuatro hijos; Mery de 12, Yeni de 10, Esther de 4 y Albino de 1 añito.&#13;&#10;Yanet nació en el distrito de Pusi, pero reside en la ciudad de Juliaca hace 4 años, no terminó sus estudios primarios debido a que se tuvo que trabajar para ayudar a su familia con la economía.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Tanzania! This is thirty-eight-year-old Josephene M.. She is married with four children between the ages of two and 18. Josephene operates a stall from which she sells traditional African cloth; she opened the stall in 2006. Josephine’s business sells a wide variety of colorful cloth with different patterns that Tanzanian women buy to fashion vitenge, their traditional outfit. The stall earns her about 100 USD per month in profits. Josephene is now requesting a loan of 875 USD to purchase large stocks of traditional African cloth in bulk. This will allow her to expand her customer base and thus earn increased profits. In the future, Josephene hopes to increase the quantity and range of cloth offered at her store even further.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>875</funded_amount><paid_amount>875</paid_amount><image><id>192720</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Each day she sells snacks  to people from a corner near her house.  A while ago she was able to get a small grill which was sufficient to prepare the kebabs she sells.   In the morning, she usually goes to purchase the meat and then prepares the kebabs, and in the afternoons and evenings she sells them in the street.    She&apos;s been doing this work for 3 years and she likes that she still has time to take care of her children.     &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; 6 months ago, she had to stop her work as she gave birth to her baby at only 7 months, and she needed to care for the baby&apos;s health.   Now she is returning to her work as her baby has grown stronger.   Even with the rough climate and cold days, she bundles up in a coat and continues her work.    Her desire to take care of her children and improve their quality of life is her great motivation.    Diana is requesting a loan to purchase more of the ingredients she needs to prepare the kebabs, such as meat and sausage.    She would like to continue to grow her business and increase her income in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Diana tiene 24 años, vive con 3 de sus 4 hijos y con su esposo.

Por lo general, en las mañanas va a comprar el corazón y las salchichas para la preparación, y sale por las tardes y noches a vender.Esto lo viene haciendo desde hace 3 años, a ella le agrada esta actividad porque no requiere de todo su tiempo y puede atender a sus hijas, pero hace 6 meses ella dejó su trabajo porque dio a luz una bebe sietemesina y tuvo que cuidar de su salud, ahora volverá a retomar su negocio porque su bebe ya se ha fortalecido.Una dificultad, pero que no la detiene, es el clima, algunos días suelen ser muy fríos, para ello Diana sale bien abrigada y con una pequeña carpa.&#13;&#10;Su esfuerza para tener mayores recursos para sostener a sus hijas y a futuro mejorar la infraestructura de su hogar.&#13;&#10;Diana solicita un préstamo para implementarse con palitos, carne y salchichas.

As she is separated from her husband, Charita has sole responsibility for her family&apos;s support  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Her work becomes difficult during the rainy season, when she can&apos;t get to the places she needs to go to buy and sell her merchandise.   If the roads are impassable, the fruit often goes bad before she can sell it.    She is requesting this loan to invest in more stock and grow her business.  She would like to be able to move her products by car or truck in the future, and sell them from her own small shop.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Charita tiene 33 años, vive con sus 4 hijos y sus ancianos padres. Ella es una mujer de mucho esfuerzo, desde hace 2 años se viene dedicando a la venta de granos; tales como habas y maíz seco, viaja a la selva dos veces por semana para vender sus granos en el mercado de esa ciudad.Allí en la selva compra fruta al por mayor para venderla en su ciudad, Huancayo. De esta manera puede sostener a sus 4 hijos que están estudiando, ya que ella es el único sostén que ellos tienen. Charita es separada de su esposo y sola corre con la economía de su hogar, por lo que cada día trabaja con mucho empeño en su casa seleccionando los granos de que ha vender y de esa manera, tener lista la mercadería para salir de viaje.  Le agrada ver de cerca lo que puede comprar para luego vender, las dificultades se presentan cuando en la época de lluvia, las carreteras se hacen inaccesibles, lo cual puede ocasionarle pérdidas y deterioro de la fruta.&#13;&#10;Solicita este préstamo para adquirir más mercadería, que le permita mayores ganancias, ella se ve un futuro moviendo un gran capital y traer por camionadas sus productos para venderlos en un local exclusivo para ello.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily

She has an 18 years old son who lives with his father. He is a college student and although he lives with his father, she supports him with his expenses.  She has 17 years of service and at the present time works for the Asuncion Hospital and for the San Ramon Clinic where she has daytime and evening shifts. She lives at her sister&apos;s house where she is going to make the improvement to the home (doors and windows, floor, ceiling, painting, etc.) At this time the room serves as a cellar.  Mrs. Suarez is asking for her sixth loan, the other five that she has taken before had been paid on time and had served her to improve the home that she lives in with her sister little by little.  Mrs. Suarez states that up to date she has constructed 2 rooms with all the furnishings and even if this loan doesn&apos;t allow her to make all the planned improvements, she will continue to apply for loans until her goal is fulfilled.  Her sister works on making and selling tamales on Saturdays and Sundays and she contributes to the monthly payments. This is the reason that she will continue to pay for this loan as she did before.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translated from Spanish by Maria Ramirez-Gregg, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lucila es trabajadora del sector salud, soltera, de 41 años de edad, con 1 hijo  de 18 años que vive con su padre, su hijo es estudiante universitario, pero aunque vive con el papá ella le da todos los gastos, tiene 17 años de servicio, actualmente labora para el Hospital Asunción y para la clínica San Ramón donde hace turnos diurnos y nocturnos, habita en casa de su hermana donde se realizará la mejora de vivienda ( puertas y ventanas, piso, cielo razo, pintura, etc.) en estos momentos el cuarto está de bodega. La Sra. S. está solicitando su crédito número seis, los cinco anteriores los ha pagado en tiempo y forma y le han servido para ir poco a poco mejorando la vivienda donde ella habita junto a su hermana. La señora S. manifiesta que hasta la fecha ha construido 2 cuartos con todas las condiciones y que si este crédito no le permite hacer todas las mejoras que tiene planificado, continuará haciendo créditos hasta cumplir con la meta que se ha planteado, su hermana trabaja haciendo nacatamales que los vende sabado y domingos y le ayuda un poco con el pago de las cuotas por esta razón continuará pagando en tiempo y forma este crédito al igual que los anteriores</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>775</funded_amount><paid_amount>775</paid_amount><image><id>192802</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

He is the one in charge of contracting the meat and search for the person that will slaughter the pig. It has a cost of C$100(Nicaraguan currency). Francisca Susana has worked as a janitor at the &quot;Josefa Toledo de Aguerri&quot; National Institute of Chontales for 5 years beginning her labor at 6:00 a.m. and finishing at 3:00 p.m.  She has to wake up every day at 4:00 a.m. to fulfill her other responsibility.  She works on the pig processing business on Saturdays starting the activity a 3:00 a.m. to deliver the meat starting at 6 a.m. She has been developing this business for 3 years which allows her to have a small income of C$200 (Nicaraguan currency) to cover the family&apos;s needs and it also provides some leftover product that the family consumes.  The earnings are better when she processes 2 pigs but she generally processes one due to lack of cash.  She is asking for her third loan because she wants to expand the market and have better earnings. The loans that she had before have been paid in a responsible manner since she is an honest person.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translated from Spanish by Maria Ramirez-Gregg, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora Francisca Susana, sotera, 48 años de edad, tubo 4 hijos, 2 mujeres, 2 varones, 3 de ellos casados pero conviven con ella, está a su cargo su hijo menor de 16 años, quien es el encargado de contratar la carne y buscar la persona que sacrifica al cerdo, tiene un costo de C$100.Francisca Susana trabaja como conserje en el Instituto Nacional de Chontales &quot;Josefa Toledo de Aguerri&quot; desde hace 5 años iniciando labores a las 6:00 am finalizando a las 3:00 pm teniendo que levantarse todos los días a las 4:00 am para luego cumplir con su otra responsabilidad.Los días que dedica para el destace son los sábados iniciando la actividad a las 3:00 am para entregar la carne a partir de las 6:00 am, tiene 3 años de estar desarrollando este trabajo lo que le permite tener un pequeño ingreso de C$200 para completar los costos familiares, pero además le queda del producto para que la familia coma.

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;P&gt;The trust banks Mujeres Nahuala is made up by a group of women who come from three different remote villages around Nahualá called Patzig, Palenqeuch and Rakantela. &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Although these groups of women are used to live in their villages and like their lifestyles a lot, they have to leave their towns in order to earn some money. These towns are very poor and commercial activity is very scarce. There are very few shops out there, maybe one or two convenience store per town. Running water is a novelty and men often leave the towns to work in far away cities, even the United States. Most of the &quot;Mujeres Nahuala&quot; travel 3 days a week for 4 hours as far as the coast and Totonícapan to sell their products in the main markets over there.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;The number three is a perpetual factor with this group. This is because the women have to travel 3 days a week, they come from 3 different town, and the ladies work in 3 different economic activities. One group of 3 women are buying and selling skirts and huipilles (traditional blouses), 3 of them are buying and selling other typical clothes, and the last 3 including the president, make and embroider skirts and pañuelos. The pañuelos are the pieces fabric women use to carry their babies, their goods from the markets, and during a chilly day they will wrap the panuelos around them to stay a bit warmer.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;The president of the group who herself sows and embroiders skirts and huipilles was the one who formed the group. She was inspired by the success of other people who asked for loans before, so she wanted request one too so she can in her own business and improved her life this way. So, she went to recruit all of the members one by one. The group members went to the office and attended the pre-credit orientation session and after a couple of months later the group was formed. &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;For all of them this will be their first credit, and they are all very excited to get this opportunity to invest in their businesses and through that; in their lives and the lives of their family members.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2175</funded_amount><paid_amount>2175</paid_amount><image><id>192841</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Rosas Semetabaj Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>The villagers from San Andres Semetabaj breathe the peaceful environment of this small lovely town. Most of the villagers know each other very well which creates an environment of trust. Walking down the clean streets of San Andres one can see many people chatting and children playing. This is a typical village where people help each other out with their daily tasks. &#13;&#10;Fortunately, this cultural factor is also reflected in Las Rosas´ organization. Some members of the group are better doing the paperwork and arrange the meetings, whereas others have more acquaintances that can help the younger ones of the group to sell their products to a bigger group of customers.&#13;&#10;This is how Doña Manuela C., who is one of oldest of the group, helps the younger members. She has a store in one of the main streets at which she sells traditional blouses. Doña Manuela is very well known in the village because of her store. When a customer asks her about clothes she doesn&apos;t sell in her store, she refers them to group members like Ami. Ami is one of the younger members of the group. She also sells blouses, but from a different type, they are called croshet blouses, they have a very different look from the traditional ones.&#13;&#10;Alma G. is the president of the group. She has a sister in another group who enthusiastically told her about Friendship Bridge. Alma, formed a group with her friends and neighbours who, like her, mostly work in buying and selling clothes. &#13;&#10;They all want to invest their credit in purchasing a more diverse repertoire of clothes. The other four women, who own a food store, also want to expand the diversity of products in order to capture more clients and increase their sales. &#13;&#10;Las Rosas want to keep working hard in order to keep building their new improved life. They wish to have a solid business so they don&apos;t have to leave their families behind in order to go and sell their goods at far away markets. That&apos;s why they try to communicate well to one another about their business ideas so they are not over-supply San Andres with the same goods, says Catalina. &#13;&#10; Las Rosas are doing a great job a working together and accomplishing unity within their trust bank, with your support they will keep working in this manner and accomplishing their dreams.

He is 20 and a resident of the Sorkhrood district in Ningarhar province. Abdullah and his family have been living in their village since the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Before that they lived in Pakistan. Abdullah has two brothers and a sister and they all live with their parents. His father is about 55, and he lost his left arm in a mine explosion during the war in Afghanistan.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;When Abdullah&apos;s family returned to their homeland, Abdullah was 14 and his brothers were about 12 and 10. His father has faced some serious illnesses, so Abdullah had to accept all responsibility for being the only breadwinner for his family. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Abdullah was studying in class 7, but he had to leave school and start working. So he opened a small catering shop (tent service) in the Sorkhrood bazaar. First he made some shelves, and then purchased different equipment like plates, spoons, carpets, and other goods for his shop with capital he had of 45,000 Afghanis. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Abdullah is a hard-working man. He was able to enroll his elder brothers in a private educational course in addition to their schooling. Meanwhile, he is attempting to resume his education. But he thinks that first he must expand his business and buy enough materials for his shop, and through it increase his daily income from $8 to $12.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;This young man seems have good capability, and he tries to utilize it in his business. He has requested a 50,000 Afghanis loan from AFSG. He decided to purchase some generators, chairs and tables with this money and after a few months he will open a new shop near the old one. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Abdullah dreams about starting in his new shop, and then sesuming his remaining education. He wants to express his appreciation in advance to his lenders, and wishes them good luck.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1075</funded_amount><paid_amount>1075</paid_amount><image><id>192939</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Catering</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

She is a 41-year-old widow with no children. All her children died. She rents a 1-room house and lives with 4 people. There is neither electricity nor water.

The family gets 3 meals a day. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She buys raw materials for making alcohol from Owino Market, one of the big markets in Kampala, and uses public transport to get back to her business. She resides and works in a semi-urban and slum area, which is in the outskirts of Kampala.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Grace works 7 days a week and also rents her business premises. She gets an average of 9 customers per day and sells to all categories of people. She has been running this business for the last 6 years and has been with MCDT and the same group members for 6 years. This is her 12th loan.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Grace&apos;s major challenge is the rainy season, as her customers are inconvenienced and at times stop going to her for a drink. This is so because her place of business is covered with mud and water during the rains. Thieves also break into her business and go away with her brew. She is boastful of the improved standards of living and her business progress. Grace is aspiring to buy land, construct a commercial house, and earn some money from tenants.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1125</funded_amount><paid_amount>1125</paid_amount><image><id>192969</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pub</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

She is a 33-year-old married woman with 5 children. They are aged between 3 and 17 years. Four are in school.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;She rents a 2-room house in which she lives with 6 people. There is piped water and electricity. She resides and works in a semi-urban and slum area, which is in the outskirts of Kampala.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Edith works 7 days a week and has a retail shop. She buys her merchandise from Kampala twice a week and uses public transport. Her customers are the people of her community and those passing through.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Edith&apos;s challenges include paying high taxes, high rental charges, and high transport costs. Flooding during the rainy season is yet another challenge, as the area where she is operating is prone to floods, and this destroys her merchandise. She has been operating this business for the last 5 years and was inspired by the other shopkeepers around, and she has been able to pay school fees for her children and also improve her standard of living.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her main inspiration is owning a permanent house/home so that she can stop paying rent. She would also want to see her business progress.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>875</funded_amount><paid_amount>875</paid_amount><image><id>192982</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Her husband, Mr. Svay Sokhom, is a soldier. &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Because of the family’s increasing expenses, Chanthy needs to expand her business to increase her income. She wants a motorcycle taxi for her husband to drive. She would like to request a loan to purchase a motorcycle. She will use the remainder of the loan to purchase more rice to make noodles.

She is 33 years old, married, and has three children. She works at the Kurgan-Tube city market, selling cottonseed oil. She buys from the oil factory in the city Dushanbe and brings it to Kurgan-Tube to sell at a profitable price. Still, she does not set her prices too high; they are the lowest in the market, and because of that she has the most customers. She does not have enough goods to satisfy everyone, so she decided to increase sales volume by taking out a loan. She will repay the loan in 9 months. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ходжакулова Зебониссо жительница Вахшского района. Возраст 33 года , замужем и имеет троих детей. Работает на рынке города Курган-Тюбе. Торгует хлопковым маслом. Закупает  на масложирном комбинате города Душанбе и привозит в Курган-Тюбе продавать по выгодной цене. Но Зебониссо ставит наценку не большую , поэтому цены у нее самые низкие и по этой причине у нее много клиентов. Для того , чтобы обслужить всех у нее не хватает товара , поэтому она решила увеличить товарооборот путем получения кредита. Погасить кредит сможет в течении 9 месяцев.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>193017</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Increase

Khursheed baji wants a loan to buy cosmetics for her beauty parlor. Zubaida baji wants a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled vehicle). Bashiran baji and Shakeela baji each want a loan to buy vegetables to resell. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a group loan.

Zubaida baji wants a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled vehicle, like a &quot;tuk-tuk&quot;).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In a group loan, the loan funds are distributed among the group members, each of whom invests in her own business.

Tatyana is requesting a loan of 3500 Grivnas to purchase inventory wholesale. She is planning to buy bulk quantities of seasonal clothing, which will sell really well this fall. Eventually Tatyana would like to expand her business and start selling at other locations.

Living in Benin for about 10 years, she is married to Mr. Daniel Dohou and mother of three children: Boris, Gabriel, and Rita for whom she is still responsible. From her mother, Mrs. Abla Dogbe, she gained several years experience with selling corn. Three years ago she became independent, and she does her buying in the north of Benin, then distributes her merchandise to retailers.  &lt;P&gt;In view of the present hikes in the price of corn due to the ever-increasing cost of living, she is requesting a loan of US$ 925 to stock up.&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Dame A. Agathe est né le 8 Septembre 1967 à Lomé au TOGO.

Devenue indépendante il y a trois ans, elle s&apos;approvisionne au Nord du BENIN puis distribue sa marchandise à des détaillants. &lt;P&gt;Compte tenu de la hausse actuelle du prix du maïs due à la

Santa Lucia Group 1</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Santa Lucia is a small village with an interesting setting. Not like most villages, the church and the community centre are situated on the same square. They are a bit apart from each other which creates two important squares and gives Santa Lucia a stretched look. This is all surrounded by steep hills on which all the houses are built in a very picturesque way. This is a very pleasant town and even when it is pouring down rain and the streets have changed into little rivers, the streets are still full of people.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The women tell me they all grew up here and for that reason, they know each other very well. Most of the women have been working on their beautiful embroideries since they were very young, as the president of the group tells me. She sells her blouses to her friends and family and some of the women present are wearing her blouses today. She and three others also sew skirts.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They sell most of their goods in Sololá which is the nearest city, about one hour away. The market days there are the best day to have good business, says Paulina. Brigida travels to a town called Godines. This is a town with an crossroads where you can go to several places and because of that, many people pass by. That&apos;s why she decided to travel the 2 hours a couple of times a week to sell her goods.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Genara tells me she went to school for four years only, and she started helping her parents from then on. It is her wish to see her children who are at university now get a degree so they have more choices in what their occupation could be. Having her business means having the means to support her children in their journey to become the professionals she was not able to become. These women are struggling for a noble cause; let&apos;s support them in their struggle.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>3000</funded_amount><paid_amount>3000</paid_amount><image><id>193221</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Embroidery</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>buy
