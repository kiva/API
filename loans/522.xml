Together they live in a ger, a traditional Mongolian felt tent, in the outer ger housing districts of the city. In 2007, Ms. Jagvaral graduated from the Mongolian State University of Agriculture with a concentration in food engineering and technology. Ms. Jagvaral’s brother is a secondary school student and her sister is a cook for a local construction company. Her mother is retired and stays at home.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ms. Jagvaral is in charge of operating the small food store in her family’s yard with regular help from her mother.  The food store is in a small wooden cabin that must be kept warm by constantly keeping a fire burning in the winter. Currently, the food store sells mainly vegetables to neighbors in the surrounding ger district. With this loan of 1,500,000 MNT, Ms. Jagvaral’s family wants to expand their food store to sell a constant variety of foods beyond vegetables, such as flour, meat, rice, and candy. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the future, Ms. Jagvaral wants to expand the store’s size.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mrs. Narantuya is 46 years old and lives with her husband and 2 daughters in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her family does not own their apartment yet, but they have a mortgage loan from another bank in order to eventually own it.  She has been on schedule with her mortgage loan payments to date. It is her family’s goal to one day own their apartment. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Narantuya’s husband works as an engineer at Naran Tuul Trade and her oldest daughter is a teller at a Mongolian bank. Mrs. Narantuya supports her family by operating a beauty salon. Her youngest daughter helps her mother at the salon by giving manicures and pedicures to customers. Other services that Mrs. Narantuya’s family salon offers are body and head massages, facial treatments, and eyebrow tattoos. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When she began her business in 2001, Mrs. Narantuya’s salon was in a small space with only one massage bed. Since that time, her salon has expanded to three massage beds with a variety of other services in a larger space than before. Recently, the salon has had an average of twenty customers per day. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan of 1,200,000 MNT, Mrs. Narantuya will purchase beautician equipment which can remove freckles and tattoos and clean facial skin. The loan will hopefully allow her to expand her service offerings and give higher quality services with better equipment than she currently owns. The salon’s extra earnings will go towards her family’s expenses and reaching her family’s goal of being secure in their own apartment.  &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>679603</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Beauty Salon</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To purchase beautician equipment which can remove freckles and tattoos and clean facial skin</use><location><country_code>MN</country_code><country>Mongolia</country><town>Ulaanbaatar</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>47.916667 106.916667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>180</partner_id><posted_date>2010-12-28T22:10:09Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Narantuya</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-12-10T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>MNT</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-10T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-10T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-10T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333.34</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333.33</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>333.33</amount><local_amount>400000</local_amount><processed_date>2011-01-31T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-02-16T05:46:11Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>410000</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>191494626</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>333.34</amount><local_amount>400000</local_amount><processed_date>2011-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-03-24T09:05:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>410000.01</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>195922672</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>333.33</amount><local_amount>400000</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-15T12:18:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>410000</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201365058</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-12-29T07:01:50Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-04-15T12:18:22Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>3</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>261592</id><name>Mèla Pèla</name><description><languages type="list"><language>fr</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><fr>Mlle Pèla a un enfant en charge et est âgée de 31 ans.

Most of them live in monogamous households. On average, they are 34 years old and have two children. They live in the village of Cinzana Gare, the county town of a rural municipality in the region of Ségou (fourth administrative region of Mali). They know each other through ties of neighborhood and kinship.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The group members trade with yams, smoked fish, sesame and wax pagnes (colorful African cloth). Faced with the need to increase their working capital, the group members joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. This is their first solidarity loan.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs Binta Traoré, one of the group members, has an outstanding record of providing yams to the population of Cinzana Gare. She intends to use her loan to buy 7 sacks of yams from producers in Koutiala. She retails the yams from her home or at the market in Cinzana Gare, for cash and credit, to a clientele made up of women and men.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs Binta Traoré expects to make a monthly profit of 25,000 CFA francs which she will reinvest in her business. Her goal is to stay in her partnership with Soro Yiriwaso and thus become a wholesaler in her

Elle effectue sa vente  au comptant et à crédit, à domicile et au marché de Cinzana Gare à une clientèle composée généralement de femmes. &#10;Madame Oumou Sidibé espère réaliser avec ce prêt un bénéfice mensuel moyen de 35 000FCFA qui sera utilisé pour assurer les soins de santé des enfants. &#10;Elle a pour objectif à l’instar des autres membres du groupe de réinvestir dans l’activité afin d’augmenter son volume.&#10;</fr><en>The six members of Danaya Group (&quot;Confidence&quot;) are married women. Most of them live in polygamous households. On average, they are 45 years old and have five children. They live in the village of Cinzana Gare, the county town of a rural municipality in the region of Ségou (fourth administrative region of Mali). They know each other through ties of marriage and kinship.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The group members trade with food condiments (cans of tomato purée, okra powder and baobab leaves), watermelons, clothes and local drinks. Faced with the need to increase their working capital, the group members decided to join the loan program of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. This is their third cycle of solidarity loans.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs Oumou Sidibé, the chairwoman of the group, is a great seller of cans of tomato purée in Cinzana Gare. She intends to use her loan to buy wholesale 10 boxes of cans of tomato purée in Koutiala. She retails them from her home or at the market in Cinzana Gare, for cash and credit, to a clientele made up mostly of women.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs Oumou Sidibé expects, thanks to this loan, to make a monthly profit of 35,000 CFA francs which she will use to pay for health services for her children. Her goal, like her fellow group members&apos; goal, is to reinvest in her activity to increase her turnover.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>925</funded_amount><paid_amount>925</paid_amount><image><id>679887</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

Elles se sont connues à travers des liens de voisinage et de parenté. &#10;Les membres du groupe font le commerce de parures, de laits, d’ustensiles plastiques et de pochettes. &#10;Dans le besoin d’augmenter leur fonds de commerce, les membres du groupe ont décidé d’intégrer Soro Yiriwaso avec qui, elles sont à leur 4ème cycle de prêt.&#10; Madame Tata   Saré  est beaucoup sollicitée à Cinzana Gare pour sa vente d’ustensiles en plastiques de toutes sortes (pots, bols, assiettes, bassines, etc) surtout pendant les périodes de mariage. &#10;Elle compte utiliser son prêt pour acheter, 20 douzaines d’ustensiles en plastique composées de: pots, bols et assiettes. Elle se ravitaille au grand marché de Ségou et effectue sa vente au comptant et à crédit, à domicile, au marché de Cinzana Gare et dans les villages environnants à une clientèle composée de femmes et parfois d’hommes. &#10;Madame Tata   Saré espère réaliser avec ce prêt un bénéfice mensuel moyen de 40 000FCFA qui sera utilisé pour être réinvesti dans l’activité et prendre en charge les besoins de condiments du foyer. &#10;Elle a pour objectif de s’investir dans l’élevage des petits ruminants dans le futur.&#10;</fr><en>The four members of Horonya Group are married women. Most of them live in monogamous households. On average, they are 33 years old and have three children. They all live in the village of Cinzana Gare, the county town of a rural municipality in the region of Ségou (fourth administrative region of Mali). They know each other through ties of neighborhood and kinship.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The group members trade with fancy jewels, milk, plastic utensils and small handbags. Faced with the need to increase their working capital, the group members decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. This is their fourth cycle of solidarity loans.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs Tata Saré sells all kinds of plastic utensils (pots, bowls, plates, basins, etc.) which are in high demand in Cinzana Gare, especially during wedding periods. She intends to use her loan to buy 20 dozens of sets of plastic utensils: pots, bowls and plates. She gets her supplies at the great market in Ségou and retails them from her home, at the market in Cinzana Gare and in the neighboring villages, for cash and credit, to a clientele made up women and sometimes men.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs Tata Saré expects, thanks to this loan, to make an average profit of 40,000 CFA francs a month, which she will use to reinvest in her business and provide her family with food. Her goal for the future is to invest in rearing small ruminants.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>825</funded_amount><paid_amount>825</paid_amount><image><id>679892</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Plastics

She has an excellent reputation in this business and gets a lot of orders, especially during the rainy season, but her working capital does not permit her to satisfy her customers&apos; needs. Thus she has come to Soro Yiriwaso with whom she is on her sixth loan, to buy 18 boxes of pharmaceutical products in Sikasso so that she can satisfy the needs of her ever-growing customer base. Her merchandise is sold out of her home and in the birthing clinic in Nimbougou.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has been working with Soro Yiriwaso for more than five years. She already received two agricultural loans with a group of women from her village and she is now  on her fourth individual loan. All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan she expects to make a monthly profit of 90,000 FCFA which will be used to help cover family expenses and pay the interest on her loan, and she will reinvest any remainder in her business.

The previous loans have been properly repaid. The women sell liquid soap, &quot;pagne&quot; fabric, other fabric and used clothing with Awa K.. With her new loan, Awa plans to buy 10 bales of used clothing. She obtains her supplies at the grand market in Sikasso and sells at her house and at the market for cash, and often for credit, to customers who are both men and women. She expects to make a monthly profit of 49,000 CFA francs, of which some will be used for savings and the family&apos;s needs, the rest being re-invested in her business.

The other part will be invested in her business.  She is counting on having more capital in order to satisfy her customers further.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1375</funded_amount><paid_amount>1375</paid_amount><image><id>679942</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits &amp;

Se dedica a vender en un puesto estacionario del centro de Barranquilla ropa y calzado usados. Está vinculado a este oficio desde los 16 años cuando ayudaba a sus padres en la misma actividad. Al fallecer su padre, él se convirtió en la mano derecha de su madre y al morir ésta, quedó al frente del negocio. El señor David les compra la mercancía a varios proveedores que se dedican a cambiar en algunos barrios de Barranquilla ropa y calzado usado por utensilios de cocina como ollas, sartenes, calderos y vasos. Sus principales clientes son personas de escasos recursos de la ciudad y campesinos de zonas rurales. El siempre tiene el cuidado de comprar ropa que esté en buen estado, sin rotos, remiendos o manchas. Algunas veces le toca lavar y planchar las prendas para mejorar su apariencia. En su local tiene también un pequeño taller de zapatería en el cual repara el calzado que compra y lo deja como nuevo. Alrededor de su negocio hay otras personas que se dedican a lo mismo, pero cada uno tiene sus proveedores y su clientela habitual. Este es el tercer préstamo que el señor David tramita en la Fundación Mario Santo Domingo y planea invertirlo en comprar más ropa y calzado usado. El promedio de ventas diarias es de $ 100.000 y su margen de utilidad es del 35%. La temporada decembrina es la mejor del año y necesita aumentar su capital de trabajo. La esposa del microempresario también produce diariamente algunos almuerzos que vende a comerciantes del sector. La mayor satisfacción del señor David es haber podido criar sin penurias a sus tres hijos y lograr que el próximo año su hija menor se gradúe de enfermera superior. El dice con mucho humor que,  vendiendo ropa  y calzado usado,  es que su familia puede comprar ropa y calzado nuevo.</es><en>Mr David Enrique León V. is 48 and lives with his wife and three children in Barranquilla. He sells used clothing and shoes in a stall in the center of Barranquilla. He has been doing this work for 16 years. He started off helping his parents with this work. When his father passed away, he became his mother&apos;s main source of support. When she passed away, he became the owner of the business. David purchases merchandise from various providers in Barranquilla neighbourhoods who trade used clothing and shoes for cooking utensils such as pots, pans, bowls and glasses. His main customers are people with few resources from the city and peasants from rural areas. He always takes care to buy clothing that is in good condition, without tears, patches or stains. Sometimes he washes and irons them so that they are like new. Around his business there are other people who do the same work, but each one has their own providers and customer base. This is David&apos;s third loan with the Fundación Mario Santo Domingo and he plans to invest it in purchasing more used clothing and shoes. His daily sales average $100,000 and his margin of utility is 35%. The December season is the best of the year and he needs to increase his working capital. His wife also daily produces various lunches that she sells to merchants in the sector. David&apos;s greatest satisfaction is having been able to raise his three children without hardship, and having achieved the fact that next year his youngest daughter will graduate from nursing school. He says, with a great sense of humour, that selling used clothing and shoes allows his family to buy new clothes and shoes.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>680027</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

Velásquez tiene 50 años y vive con su marido en el barrio El Prado del municipio de Soledad, al norte de Colombia. Tiene tres hijos de 30. 25 y  23 años de su primer matrimonio, pero  viven aparte. Ella posee una panadería en la que produce pan, galletas y pudines; además vende cervezas, gaseosas y jugos. El negocio está ubicado en una esquina cerca a la terminal de transporte interdepartamental de Barranquilla y en ese sector trafican muchas personas, sin embargo, la mayor parte de las ventas las realiza en varias tiendas de barrios cercanos. La microempresaria contrató los servicios de un joven que le ayuda a atender el negocio y hacer los repartos. Ella es quien elabora los panes y demás productos. Este oficio lo aprendió en el año 2003, en Barranquilla, después de llegar desplazada por la violencia de grupos armados ilegales de extrema derecha en el municipio de San Pablo, al sur del departamento de Bolívar. La casa en la que vive la señora Merys es propia, ella recibió un subsidio de vivienda del gobierno nacional.  Este es el crédito número 16 que tramita en la Fundación Mario Santo Domingo y planea invertirlo en la compra de harina, levadura, queso, huevos, azúcar, grasas y esencias. El promedio de ventas diarias es de $ 100.000, el margen de utilidad es del 40%. En un futuro cercano, la microempresaria planea comprar un enfriador más grande, remodelar su vivienda para acondicionar mejor el local del negocio y abrir un nuevo punto de venta en el centro de Barranquilla. Ella dice que todo lo que se ha propuesto en la vida lo ha logrado, porque en su opinión, a las personas no les faltan fuerzas sino voluntad.</es><en>Merys María M.

She also sells beer, soda and juice.  Her business is located on a corner near the inter-departmental transport terminal in Barranquilla and there are a lot of people in this area.  However, most of her sales are made to stores in nearby neighborhoods.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This small businesswoman has hired a young man who helps her in her business and takes care of her deliveries.

Her average daily sales are 100,000 pesos and her profit margin is 40%.  In the near future, she plans to buy a larger chiller cabinet and remodel her home so that she has a better set up for her business premises.  She also plans to open a new sales location in the center of Barranquilla.  She says that so far she has managed to achieve everything that she has set out to achieve in life because, in her opinion, people don&apos;t lack strength, just

He enjoys his work greatly, as after buying the varied clothing, he distributes it to various cities in the country in his small truck which he drives himself. He works every day, and he rarely rests on the weekends. He works almost 12 hours a day, but he is very satisfied because he makes regular earnings; thus, each time he increases his sales volume.

Desde hace un año empezó a estudiar repostería, desde entonces, aprendió a preparar toda clase de pasteles y bocaditos, que comercializa a diferentes tiendas de por su zona, pues su escuela tiene convenio con diversos centros comerciales. Cada día prepara sus postres desde las 6 de la tarde hasta las 9 de la noche, y obtiene regulares ganancias de las ventas, por lo que esta muy satisfecha. Además tiene algunos clientes que en la actualidad le están pidiendo buffets (bocaditos de distinta variedad) que también prepara a buenos precios. Además como es una joven muy trabajadora para el futuro tiene planeado instalar un negocio de venta de pasteles y bocaditos, al por mayor, de esta manera espera seguir progresando. Es el primer crédito que tiene con MFP, y promete pagar sus cuotas puntualmente pues no quiere quedar mal con las personas que hicieron posible este aporte que le permitirá continuar trabajando en busca del progreso. Rossy tiene planeado invertir el crédito solicitado en la compra de ingredientes (como harina, aceite, manteca) que necesita al por mayor y así espera continuar trabajando. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Rossy, age 18, lives with her parents in their home. This hard-working youth works hard to help her parents. A year ago she started studying baking. She learned to make all kinds of cakes and pastries, which she sells to different stores in the area, as her school has agreements with various shopping centers. Every day she makes her desserts from 6 pm to 9 pm. She makes a regular income from the sales, and is thus very satisfied. She has various customers who are requesting buffets (varied snacks) that she also prepares at good prices. As she is a hard-working youth, she plans to open a cake and snack business in the future, where she will sell wholesale. This way, she hopes to continue progressing. This is her first loan with MFP and she promises to pay her quotas punctually as she does not want to disappoint those who are making this loan possible. This loan will allow her to continue working in the search of progress. Rossy plans to invest the requested loan in the wholesale purchase of ingredients (such as flour, oil and butter) which she needs. This way, she hopes to continue working.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>680138</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Bakery</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>to purchase ingredients for the making of snacks and cakes.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Lima</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-12.05 -77.05</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2010-12-28T15:40:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Rossy </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-12-23T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.85</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>80.46</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>82.8</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85.71</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>88.52</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-07-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.66</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>28.34</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>32.18</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.12</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>34.29</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>35.41</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>36.66</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>28.34</amount><local_amount>70.85</local_amount><processed_date>2011-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-03-24T08:51:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>79.3</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>195887084</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>32.18</amount><local_amount>80.46</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-15T11:37:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>90.05</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201327445</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>33.12</amount><local_amount>82.8</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T11:31:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>92.67</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206195992</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>34.29</amount><local_amount>85.71</local_amount><processed_date>2011-05-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-06-15T11:41:10Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>95.92</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>211269677</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>35.41</amount><local_amount>88.52</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T11:32:47Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>99.07</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216549679</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>36.66</amount><local_amount>91.66</local_amount><processed_date>2011-07-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-08-15T09:13:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>102.59</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>221718385</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-12-28T16:12:16Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-08-15T09:13:24Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>261693</id><name>Jorge  Raymundo</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>&#10;El socio pertenece al banco comunal “LOS HERALDOS”;

Desde hace 30 años se ha dedicado a la venta de lozas, lencerías y ropa en general, de acuerdo a la temporada climática, trata de  incrementar y diversificar sus productos. Es así que siempre esta en constante actividad, comprando y vendiendo, en su puesto informal de ventas, que constantemente la reubican, por no tener un puesto fijo. Su hija mayor le ayuda en esta labor y las veces que no pueden, dejan de trabajar,  y se van de compras sin mayor apuro y con mayor tranquilidad. Es así, con el pasar del tiempo, conoce sus puntos de ventas, en donde encuentra precios muy  módicos. Por ello, es que vende a precios más asequibles; por lo que cuenta con más clientes. Para María le es importante continuar en su negocio y buscar un puesto de ventas, donde realice su negocio  con mayor tranquilidad. Es su 7mo crédito con MFP, por lo que se compromete nuevamente en ser responsable con el pago de sus cuotas, considerando éste crédito muy útil en el progreso de su negocio. Con el crédito que solicita, lo invertirá en la compra de más lencerías y ropas casuales, para la temporada del año nuevo. &#10;&#10;</es><en>María, age 50, is a loving and hard-working mother. She lives in her own home with her husband and 4 children. For 30 years she has sold china and general clothing based on the season. She tries to increase and diversify her products. She is constantly working, buying and selling, in her informal sales stall which she is constantly moving, since she does not have a fixed location. Her oldest daughter helps her with this work. When they can&apos;t work, they go shopping. With the passing of time, she has become familiar with her sales points. She has very good prices, and so she has more customers. For Maria it is important to continue with her business and get a fixed sales location where she can do her work with more peace of mind. This is her seventh loan with MFP, and she promises again to be responsible with the payment of her quotas. She thinks this loan will be very useful in the progress of her business.

With the money from this loan, she will invest in her business selling clothing for women and men. She started her business with the first loan she took around 3 years ago, and she has been reinvesting all her five loans she took before this. Her dreams for the future are to buy her own house, and to have her kids go to university. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Yaquelin is a member of the group known as Cristo  y Nuestro esfuerzo (Christ and our effort) 2. She emigrated from Haiti 20 years ago, and this group is composed of Haitian citizens living in her village.  Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza&apos;s Dominican and Haitian clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the economy is dominated by the sugar cane harvest and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She thanks you for your support.

He makes his home in a simple structure with his four children. He says that his most difficult challenge is raising his children without their mother. While he continues to do so, he intends to carry on attending church.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Leonel is excited to be taking his fifth loan with Esperanza, having successfully repaid his previous loans and grown his business. He has had his business for ten years. He plans to use this loan to invest in his business by buying shoes by the dozen in different sizes, colors and for varying types of clients. He will use the profits to invest in his business, while saving part of it to eventually build a house, buy a vehicle and pay for his children&apos;s studies. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Leonel&apos;s story is representative of his group and of Esperanza&apos;s Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. His group is located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>3175</funded_amount><paid_amount>3175</paid_amount><image><id>680198</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe

For this reason she always strives to get more and more customers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Through this activity Mariela supports her family´s daily expenses. She wants enough capital to purchase more products and have a fixed stock of cosmetics that will allow her customers to buy the products they need quickly and not have to wait until the end of the month, when the orders are delivered. That´s why she has asked Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 500 soles to help her achieve her

Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza&apos;s Dominican and Haitian clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the economy is dominated by the sugarcane harvest and where running water, none of which is potable, and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their three children. She thanks you for your

They live in a periurban zone called Paraiso. She works as a teacher in a small school that she runs (her students appear in the photo). She started giving classes in the school to children ages 6 to 9 seven years ago. Bit by bit, with her husband&apos;s help, she continued with the school. The tuition that the families pay is very reasonable and the parents do not pay the monthly fees punctually. She currently only works with three teachers in the three courses that the school has. The school, called Almendor Surcos, is supported by the state. Laura wants to continue with her work, so she wants to help improve the school. With this loan she will purchase cement, paint and sand so that the children will feel more comfortable. In the future she wants to have one of the best schools and diversify it with  more classrooms.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>676584</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Education

The laws had recently changed, requiring fourplexes to have sprinkler systems installed.  “There were only five companies that did that between San Antonio, Laredo, and La Isla.  Only one company wanted to come look at my project.” Due to the high demand of this sprinkler installation service and the low supply, companies could get away with overcharging. David decided that he would get certified to install sprinkler systems and charge this service for a more reasonable price. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;David says he charges about a third of what that company charged him for a comparable job. David and his 10 employees now install sprinkler systems and fire protection in private, commercial, and government buildings.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The biggest challenges in this industry are finding credit and funding everything up-front.  “Right now my dream is just to survive.  …It’s very difficult to get credit, so you have to fund everything yourself.”  David’s clients do not pay him until the job is done, or up to 90 days later.  In the past, the people who sold the raw materials would take some of this risk by offering credit. “But now they don’t have inventory… now you go to them and say “I need this and this” and they say ‘good.  Pay me now, and I’ll go get it for you.’ So you become the financier for your clients.  Because you have to go buy the materials and then wait to be paid at the end of the job. You have to start with your money.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;That is not the only reason the industry is so difficult, David says.  “None of the other companies want to help you.  …They never tell you where to start if you want to get certified… and if anyone starts charging a cheaper rate, they start badmouthing them.  That way no one will contract them and the price never lowers.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;David is proud of his work.  “We’ve done about 200 installations. About 99% of our clients are very happy and use us again or recommend us to others.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This loan will go to buy tubing and other raw materials in order to install sprinkler systems in a 12-story building in La Isla.  David needs to buy the materials up front, “So I’m looking for credit anywhere I can.”&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Without this loan, David would have to hire fewer workers and take on smaller jobs.  David originally went to a bank, but they said they do not lend for this kind of loan. “A loan to buy a house, yes.  But to buy raw materials?  Not one cent.” &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;David hopes that eventually he can get a larger loan or a revolving line of credit.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;David supports his wife and two children with this company. He is from Mexico, but moved to the U.S. 20 years ago.  David describes himself as “a person who wants to help the community but every day it’s more difficult.”  He advises other business owners “don’t spend effort on superfluous things.”&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>in_repayment</status><funded_amount>8100</funded_amount><paid_amount>2815.06</paid_amount><image><id>675469</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Utilities</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To

Juntos viven en la comunidad de Palestina distrito de Kimbiri. Lucila, es una señora emprendedora que junto a su esposo Serapio labran la tierra hace más de veinte años para poder  darle una buena comodidad y educación a sus adorados hijos. En su parcela  tienen las plantaciones de café, cacao, hojas de coca y piña; y en tiempo de cosecha y desmonte de malezas lo realiza con la ayuda de los jornaleros. Considera que el cacao es el producto de su agrado; porque es más rentable, mientras lo venda bien maduros, obtendrá más dinero por sus granos de cacao. Los meses de enero, febrero y marzo son los periodos de lluvia, tiempo que no le deja realizar ninguna actividad. Piensa incrementar más plantaciones de cacao y para lo cual  necesita capital para comprar más hectáreas de terreno. Este es su primer crédito con MFP, por el cual se compromete a pagar puntualmente ya que posteriormente solicitará más préstamos, está satisfecha con la institución ya que le brinda demasiada facilidad. Con el crédito que solicita, piensa invertir en una pequeña bodega, ya que por la zona  que ella habita  casi no existen tiendas, razón por la cual todo los comuneros de la comunidad de Palestina pierden de su valioso día  en viajar hasta la ciudad mas cercana  para comprarse  víveres.&#10;&#10;&#10;</es><en>Lucila is 41, married and lives with her four dear children in her own house in the community of Palestina, Kimbri district.  Lucila is an enterpreneurial woman and together with her husband, Serapio, they have farmed for more than twenty years to be able to give comfort and an education to their beloved children.&#13;&#10;  In their field they have plantings of coffee, cacao, coca leaves and pineapple.  In the harvest season and when they need to clean out the underbrush,  they work with the help of day laborers.  She thinks that cacao is the best crop because it is the most profitable and when they sell it very ripe, they get more money for the cacao beans.  The months of January, February and March are the periods of rain and she is not able to do any farm work.  She is planning to increase the cacao crop and for this she needs capital to buy more hectares of land.  This is her first loan with MFP and she promises to make the payments on time since she would like to have more loans in the future.  Lucila is happy with the institution since it offers easy terms.  With this loan she would like to have a small store since there are almost none in the area where she lives.  Because of this all of the people in the community of Palestina waste a valuable day when they have to go to the closest city to buy supplies.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1075</funded_amount><paid_amount>1075</paid_amount><image><id>680417</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

They live in the San Franciscio district, Ayachucho province, in their own house.  Previously Zonia had a restaurant where she worked full time and where she prepared a variety of national dishes.  Nevertheless, 3 months ago she was offered a good business opportunity, to rent out the space of this business.  Now there is an appliance store there, and with time and her earnings she hopes to be able to finish building her 3 story house.  She would rent the first and second floors for businesses, but on the third floor her family would live in 4 rooms, with the other 5 for rent.  The rents have generated good earnings and that is why she plans to improve the rooms in the house.  This is her 16th loan with MFP and she promises to make all the payments punctually.  She is a responsible member and is happy with her communal bank because of the benefits offered her.  She will use the 1000 sols to fix up the rooms in the house to be able to give better services to her tenants.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>375</funded_amount><paid_amount>375</paid_amount><image><id>680454</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Property</activity><sector>Housing</sector><use>To fix up the rooms in her house to be able to give a better quality of life to her family</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Ayacucho</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-13.158333 -74.223889</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2010-12-29T00:10:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>375</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Zonia </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-12-11T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>375</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-11T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>153.86</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-11T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.68</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-11T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>165.76</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>168.84</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>174.49</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>178.37</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>57.7</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>59.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.16</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>63.32</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>65.43</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>66.89</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>57.7</amount><local_amount>153.86</local_amount><processed_date>2011-01-31T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-02-16T04:39:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>161.44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>191463710</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>59.5</amount><local_amount>158.68</local_amount><processed_date>2011-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-03-24T08:52:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>166.49</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>195887093</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.16</amount><local_amount>165.76</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-15T11:36:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>173.93</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201327454</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>63.32</amount><local_amount>168.84</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T11:32:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>177.15</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206196001</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>132.32</amount><local_amount>352.86</local_amount><processed_date>2011-05-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-06-15T11:41:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>370.24</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>211269685</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-12-29T19:48:19Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-06-15T11:41:38Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>261769</id><name>Fanny Antonia</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Fanny Antonia labora en su propio negocio, una pulpería en la que ofrece a sus vecinos golosinas, refrescos, pan, granos básicos entre otras cosas así es como recibe mejores ingresos para subsistir diariamente y aportar a su hogar.

En Pampa del Carmen, donde se ubica el restaurante de Estefania, los platos exquisitos que prepara, son el deleite de todos los pobladores de su localidad; según menciona en temporadas turísticas, y fechas importantes del país, recibe mucha clientela, tanto así que hay fechas que no se abastece. Ahora Estefania, recibe el apoyo de sus hijos con los cuales pudo abrir una tienda de comestibles, donde vende productos de primera necesidad, y para más adelante sueña con convertirlo en un minimercado. Es la décima vez que trabaja con MFP, y agradece el apoyo recibido por parte de su banco comunal, y a todas las personas que hacen posible la obtención del préstamo. De obtener el crédito que solicita, lo invertirá en la compra de insumos para surtir su tienda de comestibles, sobre todo en está época de año nuevo, que la demanda es mayor. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Estefania, age 62, has been a widow for 6 years; despite this, she has never waned and has kept seeing her 4 children, of whom only 3 live with her in their own home in the city of La Merced (in the central peruvian forest): Jose, age 34, Andrea, age 33, and Jorge, age 22. In Pampa del Carmen, where Estefania&apos;s restaurant is located, the exquisite dishes that she prepares are the delight of all the townspeople. She says that she has many customers during the tourist season and on important dates for the country. There are also times when she does not have many customers. Now, with her children&apos;s support, she and her children are opening a food store, where she sells basic staples. In the future she hopes to convert it into a minimarket. This is her tenth loan with MFP, and she is grateful for the support of her community bank, and to all of the people who are making it possible for her to obtain this loan. When she obtains this loan, she will invest in the purchase of items to stock her food store, as the demand is greater in the new year.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>680465</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Ambos tienen 3 hijos, pero solo viven con 2 de ellos: Melina, de 24 y Enit, de 20 años de edad. En unión familiar ellos viven en su casa propia, ubicada en la ciudad de San Ramón (selva central peruana). Desde hace 20 años, Marina tiene una tienda de comestible, y una juguería (venta de bebidas a base de frutas) llamada “Talía”, según menciona en periodo de navidad implementó su tienda de comestibles con panteones, vinos, chocolates y bastante leche; con ello está adquiriendo buenas ganancias. También Marina se está preparando para dar pensión a los profesores de su zona en época escolar, cocinando ricos platos criollos para su alimentación diaria, es por está razón que ella desea más adelante ampliar su negocio, no solo con comestibles, o jugos, sino también con un restaurante y convertirlo en un lugar donde las personas puedan encontrar de todo para la hora de comida. Ahora ella se está preparando para el periodo de verano, donde comercializa  gran cantidad de bebidas. Es el octavo crédito con MFP, y se siente agradecida con el trabajo realizado por los integrantes de su banco comunal, que son personas responsables y muy honestas. De adquirir el crédito que solicita, podrá comprar frutas por cajones, que le servirán para preparar las ricas bebidas, entre jugos y chupetes que en época de verano tienen gran acogida. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Marina is 46 years old.

They live in their own home in the town of San Ramon (in the central Peruvian jungle).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Marina has owned a grocery store and a &apos;jugueria&apos; (selling fruit-based drinks) called &apos;Talia&apos; for 20 years.  She tells us that over the Christmas period she stocked her grocery store with panettones, wine, chocolates and quite a bit of milk.  She is making good profits from this.  Marina is also preparing to provide food to local teachers during the school year, cooking rich creole dishes for their daily meals.  In the future, she would like to expand her business,  not only with food or juices and smoothies but also with a restaurant.  She would like to convert her business into a place where people can find everything they need at meal times.  Marina is currently preparing for the summer season when she will sell a large quantity of drinks.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is Marina&apos;s eighth loan with MFP and she feels grateful for the work done by the members of her community bank.  They are all responsible and very honest people.  Marina will use her loan money to buy fruit by the crate load which she will use to prepare her rich drinks, smoothies and lollipops which are very popular in the summer.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>680489</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Soft

He is married and has two children.  Omurjan was born into a family of farmers and helped his parents with farming and cattle breeding, which helped him gain useful experience.  After serving in the army, Omurjan worked as a tractor driver at the state farm.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 1995, Omurjan decided to start his own cattle breeding business in order to earn a living to support his family.  Omurjan bought one bull-calf with the money that he had put aside for a rainy day.  Due to his persistent and hardworking personality, Omurjan managed to multiply his investments and bought a used car.  Today, his farm has two milk cows and he sells their milk at the local market.  He also has three horses and forty sheep. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Omurjan is applying for a loan of 120,000 KGS to buy two milk cows and three bull-calves.  With the revenue, he plans to broaden his business by purchasing more cattle for fattening.  In the future, Omurjan plans to buy a house for his family in the town of Karabalta. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The Kiva partner Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading microfinance institutions in Kyrgyzstan.

She and her husband usually go to buy chicken in bulk at the cheapest price possible from rural people whose houses are full of poultry that they raise for selling. In addition, her husband is also a local farmer, and now he grows a few watermelons in his farmland. When it is mature, he always picks the finished product to sell in the busy market for extra fee. The coming rainfall is good for his crop, but now her husband doesn’t have capital yet to use on his farm.

Yem S. is a singer, and she always goes in and around her community to sing some songs with her orchestra for earning profit. She could get an income with this job at about $2 a day. She is married to Mr. Teng Sokhun, age 27, and he makes a living selling ice cream in his village. This couple has given birth to a kid who is studying in local school. Currently, her husband’s business is not running smoothly because his old barrel, which he used to put ice cream for selling, is broken down due to use and process. Yem S.’s husband wishes to change a new one but he lacks fund to make it possible. To encourage him, Yem S. will use her loan for her husband to purchase a new barrel in order to replace the broken one so he can go back to ice-cream selling business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>676120</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home

She currently plants a peanut crop and she estimates that she will harvest it within the next two months when the plants mature. York S. will use the income from selling her mature produce to better meet her family’s needs. Her husband helps her to grow crops.

One of her daughters is married and lives separately from her mother, and another daughter is a student in Yerevan. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Five years ago Margarita organized her own business in a rented shop, and now she runs a gift shop and photographic studio at the same place. Her daughter&apos;s husband helps Margarita at her business, so part of the business income goes to her daughter&apos;s young family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She and her son-in-law take pictures and develop photographic films by themselves, and at the gift shop Margarita sells toys, pictures, clocks, statuettes, photo albums, frames and so on. With her son-in-law&apos;s help Margarita buys merchandise from Yerevan once a month. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Margarita is asking for a 750,000 AMD loan to increase her gift shop assortment and to buy photographic paper, cartridges, etc. for her photographic studio. This is her 4th loan from Nor Horizon, and she has never delayed her repayments.

Desde entonces se dedica a la venta de especias molidas, verduras y frutas, negocio que le esta yendo muy bien. Ella se siente muy contenta con su tienda, ya que además de vender sus productos, se interrelaciona con sus vecinas. Su buen trato y su paciencia, han hecho que su negocio sea el más concurrido y preferido por sus clientes, por lo que se siente muy motivada a seguir trabajando. Por el momento solo atiende por su ventana, ya que el ambiente de su casa no fue diseñada para este fin; es por ello que planea ampliar su negocio, asimismo desea vender productos naturales, productos que ella misma consume. Es su segundo crédito con MFP, y sabe que le será muy útil este aporte, por ello se compromete pagar puntualmente sus cuotas de acuerdo al cronograma. Con el crédito que solicita, comprará gaseosas y productos lácteos para implementar su tienda.&#10;&#10;</es><en>Mercedes, 55, is a very hardworking mother.  She lives in her own house, together with her husband and their two children.  Her first business was a book store, but time proved that it was not profitable so she decided to change direction.  Now she sells basic perishable goods like ground spices, vegetables, and fruits, and her business is doing very well.  She feels very happy with her store because not only does she sell her products, but she also gets to interact with her neighbors.  Her patience and good customer service have won her customers&apos; preference and made her business the busiest around.  Therefore, she feels very motivated to keep working.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;For now, she only tends to her customers through her window, as her house was not designed for this purpose.  For this reason, she plans to expand her business.  She would also like to sell natural products, which she consumes herself.  This is her second loan through MFP and she knows that this support will be very useful.  She promises to make punctual repayments according to the established schedule.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She will use this loan to buy soft drinks and dairy products to expand her store.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>375</funded_amount><paid_amount>375</paid_amount><image><id>680873</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to buy soft drinks and dairy products</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Lima</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-12.05 -77.05</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2010-12-29T16:40:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>375</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Mercedes</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-12-23T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>375</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>167</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>167</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>167</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>167</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>167</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>165</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.63</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.62</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.63</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.62</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.63</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>61.87</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>62.63</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2011-01-31T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-02-16T04:40:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>175.73</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>191463718</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.62</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2011-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-03-24T08:52:37Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>175.72</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>195887101</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.63</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-15T11:37:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>175.73</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201327462</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.62</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T11:33:03Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>175.72</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206196009</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.63</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2011-05-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-06-15T11:42:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>175.73</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>211269693</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>61.87</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T11:33:13Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>173.62</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216549693</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-12-29T20:27:38Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-07-15T11:33:13Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>261914</id><name>Angela Nelly</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Angela Nelly R.

He currently works from Monday to Saturday, from very early in the morning, making wooden furniture and designs that his father helps him with.

A refugee from Nagorno-Karabakh, he lives with his family in a small settlement built for refugee families in the Sabirabad region. He has a little son who is two years old. The hardship of being refugees made it difficult for Etibar to support his family so he decided to start his own livestock-breeding business in 2008 and since that time he is doing well. This is his first loan of 1100 AZN with Aqroinvest and Kiva to buy two cows. Now he has five. He also breeds other types of animals. Etibar is sure that having more cows will allow him to further increase his family&apos;s income which now is only 350 AZN per month. He foresees a bright future for his cattle-breeding business. He is a diligent man who, after repaying this loan, plans to buy ten more cows.

She fled with her big family to Bilasuvar in 1993. Durna is an entrepreneurial woman and together with her husband, they did their best for many years to give comfort and an education to their beloved children, but it was difficult to cover all their needs. Durna decided to start her cattle-breeding business in 2003. Now the monthly income of the family is around 500 AZN. Her three sons help her in this business. With this loan of 1200 AZN she bought three cows. This is her first loan with AqroInvest and Kiva and she promises to make the payments on time since she would like to take out more loans in the future. She is planning to enlarge her cattle-breeding business and increase her number of cows to twelve.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1525</funded_amount><paid_amount>1525</paid_amount><image><id>680791</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>to

In 2005, to help provide for the family, she went into the business of selling jewelry, and since has gained a lot of clients. Vahida sells rings, watches, bracelets and other gold accessories. This is the first loan Vahida has taken from Aqroinvest and Kiva.

He is an internal refugee from Nagorno-Karabakh who fled to the Sabirabad district of Azerbaijan in 1993. Mubariz is the head of his large family and the hardship of being refugees made it difficult for him support them. That is why in 2004 he started his animal breeding and selling business with the little savings he had. He gradually expanded his business, which is the only source of income for his family. His sons, who are 24 and 28, actively help him in business. Now he has seven cows and a monthly income of 300 AZN. This is his second loan from AqroInvest and Kiva. After successfully repaying his previous loan he requested another loan of 1300 AZN to buy three cows. In the future Mubariz wants to expand his business and have a farm.

Asmar lives in the southern part of Azerbaijan in the town of Imishli. Asmar is married and has one son and two daughters, aged 23 and 21. Asmar gets a monthly pension in the amount of 85 AZN. This income is not sufficient for her big family, consisting of 5 members. In 2004, Asmar decided to start her cattle-breeding business and since then her income has considerably increased. She also breeds other types of livestock. Asmar is very grateful, because with this first loan in the amount of 1000 AZN that she received from Aqroinvest and Kiva, she was able to buy two more cows. Now she has five cows and her family&apos;s monthly income from this business is 250 AZN. Asmar is a very industrious woman.

En unión familiar ellos viven en su casa propia, ubicada en la ciudad de La Merced (selva central peruana). Las manos prodigiosas de este talentoso hombre le enseñaron a depender hace 5 años, de lo que hoy es su mejor pasatiempo y distracción “la sastrería”, ahí confecciona prendas de vestir, además de hacer composturas, teñidos, planchados, y demás servicios que brinda en su propio taller, ubicado en una zona estratégica de la ciudad. Lo que más le gusta a este talentoso hombre, es poder crear sus propias prendas de vestir, pues según afirma, “es una diversión”. Por ello más adelante está pensando, acondicionar su taller con una pequeña tienda de venta de ropa que el mismo confeccionará. Es el segundo crédito con MFP, y como socio activo de su banco comunal espera seguir trabajando conjuntamente con sus integrantes, y de esa manera lograr sus objetivos. De obtener el crédito podrá adquirir diversas telas para la confección de diferentes prendas de vestir. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Pascual, age 57, is an amazing single father of two children:  Elías (age 27) and Elizabeth (age 22).  His family lives in his own home located in the city of La Merced in the central Peruvian jungle.  The prodigious hands of this talented man have taught him to become self-dependent for the past five years.  Today he spends most of his time and energy tailoring, which includes making and mending clothes.  In addition, he provides dyeing and ironing services from his own shop located in a strategic area of the city.  What this talented man enjoys most is designing his own clothes because he says “it is fun”.  Later on he plans to convert his workshop into a small clothing store where he can sell the garments he makes.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;This is his second loan with MFP.  As a member of his Communal Bank, Pascual hopes to continue working with the other members to achieve their objectives.  With the loan he will receive, Pascual will acquire various fabrics to produce different types of clothes.

He makes his home in a simple structure with his wife and a child. He says that his most difficult challenge have been to develop his business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Marcelo is excited to be taking his third loan with Esperanza, having successfully repaid his previous loans and grown his business. He has had his business for 5 years. He plans to use this loan to invest in his business to buy rice, flour and other foods.  He will use the profits to buy a vehicle that he needs to transport the goods to his business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Marcelo&apos;s story is representative of his group and of Esperanza&apos;s Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. His group is located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.

Ambos en unión familiar viven en su casa propia, ubicada en la ciudad de La Merced (selva central peruana). Está exitosa mujer se dedica hace 8 años a la venta de comida, en un restaurante que abrió en sociedad con su mamita Rosa a la que quiere mucho. Lo que más le gusta a María es cocinar comida criolla, ya que eso le permite dar pensión a los que trabajan en la policía nacional del Perú, donde tiene que cocinar una porción considerable para el desayuno, almuerzo y cena. Sin embargo está pensando abrir una tienda grande y bien equipada de mercadería como ropa variada y regalos para toda ocasión, y según menciona en estos meses ya dará el primer paso. Es el quinto crédito con MFP, y se siente orgullosa de trabajar con los integrantes de su banco comunal. De obtener el crédito solicitado, podrá comprar prendas de vestir, juguetes y demás pedidos de sus clientes y amistades que tiene.&#10;&#10;</es><en>María is 39 years old and lives with her 65-year-old father, Helman, and her 56-year-old mother, Rosa.  They live together in a house that they own, located in the city of La Merced in the central Peruvian jungle.  This successful woman has worked selling food for eight years in a restaurant that she opened in collaboration with her mother, who she loves very much.  What María likes most is cooking Creole food because it allows her to provide meals for the people who work for the Peruvian National Police.  There, she has to cook a considerable portion for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  However, she is planning to open a large store that is well-equipped with merchandise such as varied clothing and gifts for every occasion.  She mentions that in the months to come, she will take the first step.  This is her fifth loan with MFP and she is proud to work with the members of her communal bank.  In obtaining the loan requested, she will be able to buy clothing, toys and the other requested items from her customers and

Her husband works as a farmer and he helps her with the household expenses.  Cruz farms different lands with her husband and they are now harvesting different crops such as spinach and green beans.  She sells the crops in a local cooperative where she lives, and sells another part to her customers that already know her at the local market.  She is requesting the loan because she needs to invest more in the purchase of manure and seeds to continue growing new products, since she needs to have other crops already planted at the end of the harvest.  Her dream is to finish providing her young children with an education.  Although working in the field is not easy, she is happy to have the opportunity to get her family ahead.  She is a woman who is responsible with her payments because she says that it corresponds to the confidence provided through granting her the

Abraham, de 54 años de edad, a los que quiere y cuida en su casa propia ubicada en el caserío de Cumutay. Desde que tenia 20 años de edad, se dedico a la agricultura, sus principales cultivos constan de papa y alverjas; lo que más le gusta de su labor es poder cuidar de su becerra mientras limpia la maleza que crece entre sus sembríos, pero lo que no le gusta a Elizabeth, son las temporadas donde los agricultores cosechan gran cantidad de hortalizas, ya que saturan el mercado y no le permite tener buenas ganancias. Pero es en está temporada que ella, deja secar la alverja, la cual se convierte en semilla, vendiendo el saco de semilla de alverja a un mayor precio; en el mercado central de Tarma, lo que le permite estabilizar su economía. Por todos lo aciertos que tiene está pensando abrir un restaurante en su zona, ya que no existe una. Es el octavo crédito con MFP, y como mujer joven, asegura que el papel que cumple su banco comunal en su vida, es preponderante, ya que le ayuda a crecer y forjarse nuevas metas. De obtener el crédito comprará 15 sacos de abono orgánico que oscila entre los 100 nuevos soles aproximadamente. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Elizabeth is 26 years old and single.  She is a hard-working woman who lives with her mom, 52 year-old Abelarda, and her dad, 54 year-old Abraham.  She loves and looks after her parents in their own home which is located in the village of Cumutay.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since she was 20 years old, Elizabeth has been working as a farmer.  Her main crops are potatoes and peas.  What she most likes about her work is being able to look after her calf while she clears away the weeds that grow between her crops.  What Elizabeth does not like are the seasons when farmers grow a large quantity of vegetables because they flood the market and she can&apos;t make good profits.  In this season she is leaving her pea crop to dry.  She will convert it into seed and will sell sacks of pea seed at a higher price in the central market in Tarma which will allow her to stabilize her finances.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With all the good decisions that she has made, Elizabeth is thinking of opening a restaurant in her area because there isn&apos;t one at present.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is Elizabeth&apos;s eighth loan with MFP and, as a young woman, she assures us that her community bank plays a predominant role in her life since it helps her to grow and set herself new goals.

action). She makes her home here in a simple structure with her husband and their only child. She says that her biggest challenge is to help her daughter to become a professional.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Juana is excited to be taking her third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for almost 16 years, starting to work from her house after a cousin motivated her to buy a hair dryer. She started her beauty salon in her living room; she decided to do it and little by little, she bought everything. She plans to use this loan to invest in her beauty salon by buying hair and cosmetic products. She also wants to buy a professional blower. She will use the profits to reinvest in her business and to save for her daughter&apos;s studies.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza&apos;s Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in the urban slums surrounding Santo Domingo. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable electricity and running water, none of which is potable.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Ivelisse is an entrepreneur whose business has improved as a result of a loan for her small beauty salon.  She also sells miscellaneous items, including phone cards. Ivelisse lives and does business near Hato Mayor, an agricultural area. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, lacks reliable electricity and potable running water. Ivelisse makes her home in a simple structure with her husband and their 4 children. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has had her business for about 2 years, starting when she received her first loan from Esperanza and bought her first clothing merchandise. Ivelisse plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing clothes, women&apos;s handbags, and calling cards. She will use the profits to re-invest in her business, because she needs to buy a hair dryer. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ivelisse says that her most difficult challenge is to buy a plot of land in the town to start building a house. In the meantime she plans to continue enjoying working in her beauty salon. Her story is generally representative of her group and of Esperanza&apos;s Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti).

S. sigue elaborando prendas de vestir en su taller de la ciudad de Barranquilla. Los meses de Diciembre y Enero son de temporada alta porque empieza a producir uniformes escolares a varios colegios de la ciudad que inician labores a principio de Febrero. Recientemente recibió la propuesta de elaborar los disfraces a dos comparsas que desfilarán en los próximos carnavales de Barranquilla, la fiesta folclórica más importante de Colombia y está estudiando la oferta. Este es el séptimo crédito que tramita en la Fundación Mario Santo Domingo y planea invertirlo en la financiación de la matrícula del segundo semestre de su hijo en la universidad. Decidió hacer el préstamo para no descapitalizar el negocio. El crédito anterior, que también fue destinado a financiar los estudios superiores de su hijo, ha sido cancelado con una impecable puntualidad. El señor Jairo le manda un saludo muy especial a todos sus financiadores de Kiva, deseándoles mucha salud y prosperidad en compañía de sus familiares y agradeciéndoles la filantropía de ayudar a personas de escasos recursos.

He makes the uniforms for various schools in the city that start at the beginning of February.  He recently received a proposal to make the costumes for two groups who will parade in the next carnivals in Barranquilla.  The folkloric fiesta is the most important one in Colombia, and he is studying the offer.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is his seventh loan with the Fundación Mario Santo Domingo.  He plans to use the loan for the entrance fees for his son’s second semester in the university.  He decided to ask for the loan so that he would not take money out of his business. His previous loan was also to pay for his son’s college education, and that payment was made very punctually.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jairo sends very special greetings to all of the Kiva lenders.  He wishes them much health and prosperity as they are surrounded by their families.  He thanks them for the philanthropy of helping people who have scarce resources.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To learn about the previous loan given to this small businessman, click on the following link:

Ella vive en una zona que se encuentra algo alejada de la ciudad, por lo que ha sido muy difícil trasladar todos los productos que tiene que ofrecer en los diferentes lugares que recorre, pues va a los mercados, buses, entre otros. Por lo que desea adquirir una buena calidad de productos para ofrecer a sus clientes. Para ello ha creído conveniente solicitar un crédito para la compra de ropa interior, pantalones, camisas, faldas y trajes para niños. Maria es una mujer bastante activa y que gusta mucho de trabajar para ayudar a su esposo a salir adelante. Las personas que le conocen le tienen mucha estima y le consideran una mujer de confianza.</es><en>Maria Eulalia is 35 years old.  She sells clothing for a living.  She lives in an area that is somewhat removed from the city.  Since she travels to the market by bus or other means of transportation, it has been very difficult to transport all of her products to the various locations where she sells them. So, she wants to buy good quality products to offer her customers.  For this reason, she believes it is appropriate to request a loan to buy undergarments, pants, shirts, skirts, and children’s suits.  Maria is an active woman who really enjoys working in order to help her husband get ahead in life. The people who know her hold her in high regard and consider her a confident woman.

She intends to use her loan to buy 20 sacks of organic fertilizer at a price averaging 100 nuevos soles each.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>681097</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Flowers</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To buy 20 sacks of organic fertilizer</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>TARMA</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-11.419722 -75.690833</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-01T08:00:28Z</posted_date><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Nancy </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-12-23T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>2000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-21T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-21T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>725</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>725</amount><local_amount>2000</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T11:33:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2034.35</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216549700</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-02T16:08:08Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-07-15T11:33:26Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>262014</id><name>Nelson</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>El señor Nelson S. M. tiene 53 años y vive con su esposa y una nieta en la urbanización Villas De San Pablo de la ciudad de Barranquilla. Logró adquirir su casa a través de un subsidio que recibió del estado. Esta urbanización es  el primer macroproyecto de vivienda  en Colombia liderado por la Fundación Mario Santo Domingo en asocio con el gobierno local y nacional. El microempresario es albañil de profesión y desde hace 18 meses tiene una pequeña ferretería que funciona en su residencia y en la cual vende materiales de construcción, artículos eléctricos y herramientas. En un principio el inventario y las ventas eran bajos, pero han crecido mes a mes porque cada vez hay más familias viviendo en el barrio y casi todas remodelan sus casas. En la atención del negocio, se turna con su esposa quien también presta el servicio de llamadas a teléfonos fijos y celular. Este es el primer crédito que tramita en la Fundación y planea invertirlo en comprar cemento,  ladrillos, láminas para techos y accesorios para tuberías en P.V.C. Esos son los artículos que más vende. El promedio de ventas diarias es de $ 120.000 COP y el margen de utilidad es del 35%.  El señor Nelson se declara un hombre afortunado porque ha sobrevivido a dos graves accidentes en motocicletas que le produjeron varias fracturas. Hoy está plenamente recuperado y no le quedaron secuelas. A principio del próximo año visitará un hijo que vive en la ciudad de Cali y su compañera quedará al frente del negocio por una semana.  En un futuro no muy lejano piensa construir un segundo piso en su residencia para separar su vivienda del negocio y así mejorar su calidad de vida.</es><en>Mr Nelson S. M. is 53 and lives with his wife and a granddaughter in the Villas de San Pablo development of the city of Barranquilla. He was able to acquire his house through a subsidy that he received from the state. This development is the first housing macroproject in Colombia lead by the Fundación Mario Santo Domingo in association with the local and national governments. Nelson is a bricklayer and has had a small hardware store in his home for 18 months, where he sells construction materials, electronic items and tools. In the beginning the inventory and sales were low, but they have grown month by month because each time there are more families living in the neighbourhood and almost all of them are remodeling their homes. He and his wife take turns working in the store. His wife also provides a landline and cell phone service. This is Nelson&apos;s first loan with the Fundacion, and he plans to invest it buying cement, bricks and laminates for roofs, and accessories for PVC tubes. These are the items that he sells the most. His daily sales average $120,000 COP and the margin of utility is 35%. Nelson says he is a lucky man because he has survived two serious motorcycle accidents that left him with various fractures. Today he is fully recovered and he has no lasting consequences. In the beginning of next year he will visit a son who lives in the city of Cali, and his wife will stay and look after the business for one week. In the near future he plans to build a second floor in his home to separate the living area from the business, thus improving their quality of life.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>681101</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Hardware</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to

Desde las primeras horas de la mañana Gaby, comienza la venta de productos de primera necesidad en un pequeño espacio que acondicionó en su casa. Cuando termina su venta, ella, se dirige a sus sembríos de arveja, papa y maíz, donde hace 15 años comenzó a dedicarse a la agricultura, y según menciona la va muy bien; pues ahora la calidad de sus productos son muy cotizados en el mercado central de Tarma. Según afirma el movimiento económico del mercado es muy bueno, por ello está planeando invertir en la venta de verduras al por mayor. Es el octavo crédito con MFP, y como presidenta de su banco comunal, se siente dichosa de ayudar a las personas a salir adelante. De obtener el crédito está pensando completar la compra de 5 sacos de semilla de arveja, que oscila entre 600 soles cada uno.&#10;&#10;</es><en>Gabi, age 25, lives with Andres, age 34.

In the first hours of the morning Gaby starts to sell basic needs products in a small area she set up in her home. When she finishes her sales, she sows peas, potatoes and corn. She started working in agriculture 15 years ago, and she says that it is going very well. Her quality products are very sought-after in the central market of Tarma. She says that the economic market movement is very good, and so she plans to invest in the wholesale sale of vegetables. This is her eighth loan with MFP, and as the  president of her community bank she is happy to help people get ahead. When she obtains this loan she plans to purchase five bags of pea seeds, which are approximately 600 soles each.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>681114</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>to purchase 5 bags of pea seeds.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>TARMA</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-11.419722 -75.690833</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-01T08:00:28Z</posted_date><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Gabi </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-12-23T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-21T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-21T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1500</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>550</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>550</amount><local_amount>1500</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T11:33:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1543.3</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216549701</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-02T18:13:45Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-07-15T11:33:46Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>262020</id><name>Elsa Mariana</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Elsa Mariana Ordoñez R. o Ordoñez M. tiene 44 años es casada y tiene 6 hijos cuatro de ellos ya  estan casados y dos todavía van a la escuela su negocio es de venta de refacciones frutas y granizadas doña elsa a tenido mucha demanda en su negocio con la ayuda de su esposo han podido sacar adelante a su familia y necesitan la  ayuda de Fape  para que puedan otorgarle un crédito y que puedan invertir en su negocio y asi puedan generar mas ganancias y brindarle una mejor vida a su familia, Ella solicita el crédito para la  compra de productos comestibles para elavorar comida   </es><en>Elsa Mariana Ordoñez R. o Ordoñez M. is 44 years old, married and has 6 kids, four of whom are already married and two whom are already in school.

Lo que más le gusta a Nilda, es cuidar de sus animales como vacas, toros, cerdos y corderos. Ya tiene 20 años dedicándose a ello, y afirma que a pesar de los inconvenientes que se suscitan constantemente, como en temporadas de lluvia, cuando aparece la enfermedad de “la rancha”, malogrando los sembríos. Ella tiene mucha fe y ganas de trabajar, ya que el campo “es su vida”, ahí nació y creció. Por ello más adelante desea construir una casa más segura donde pueda vivir y poner un negocio propio.

She is married to Samuel, 47 years old. Together they have 5 children, but they only live with 4 of them in their own home located in the rural town of Cumutay. This hard-working woman works in agriculture. Together with her son, Wilder, she heads to work every morning to her fields of beans, potatoes and rice where they work hard from dawn until dusk. What Nilda enjoys most is the care of her animals such as cows, bulls, pigs and sheep. She has already worked 20 years in this and upholds it despite the inconveniences that they are constantly experiencing such as rainy seasons, outbreaks of the “la rancha” sickness, and spoiling the seeds. She has a lot of faith and desire to work, since the country “is her life,” where she was born and grew up. In the future, she wants to build a more secure house where she can live and have her own business. This is her eighth loan with MFP, and as a longtime member of her communal bank, she is thankful for all the support that she receives from then.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Once she obtains the loan that she requested, she will invest it in the purchase of various bags of fertilizer, which she will use on her potato crops.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>681126</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To purchase several bags of fertilizer</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>TARMA</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-11.419722 -75.690833</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-01T08:00:28Z</posted_date><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Nilda </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-12-23T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>2000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-21T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-21T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>725</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>725</amount><local_amount>2000</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T11:34:07Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2034.35</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216549702</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-01T19:19:29Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-07-15T11:34:07Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>262024</id><name>Flor De Maria</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Flor De Maria tiene 33años, su actividad es la compra y venta de ropa.

El trabajo de Marcelina, es la venta de productos de primera necesidad en su tienda de comestibles, donde todas las mañanas desde muy temprano abre sus puertas para comercializarlos  a los pobladores de su localidad; pero como ella es una mujer muy activa, por la tarde se dirige a sus cultivos de papa, maíz y arveja, los cuales cuida desde hace ya 20 años, donde pudo aprender no solo las técnicas de cultivo, también a comercializar a buen precio sus cosechas en el mercado mayorista de su ciudad. Pero el pasatiempo de ella es cuidar de sus animales entre vacas y carneros. Ahora Marcelina, desea aumentar la cantidad de animales que posee para poder incursionar en la elaboración de queso. Es el octavo crédito con MFP, y se siente orgullosa de pertenecer a su banco comunal, donde sus integrantes son personas integras y sobre todo responsables. De obtener el crédito solicitado, planea invertir en la compra de 5 bolsas de semilla de arveja, que oscilan entre los 550 soles cada uno. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Marcelina, age 42, is a single and hard-working woman who lives with her mother Julia, age 76. She cares for her mother in her own home in the Cumutay hamlet. Marcelina sells basic needs products in her food store, where she opens her doors very early every morning to sell to the residents of the area. Since she is a very actie woman, she cares for her potato, corn and bean crops in the afternoon. She has been doing this for 20 years, and she has learned not only the cultivation techniques, but also how to sell her harvests at a good price in the wholesale market of her city. Her pass-time is caring for her animals, cows and sheep. Marcelina wants to increase the amount of animals that she has in order to start making cheese. This is her eighth loan with MFP, and she is proud to belong to her community bank, where the members are upright and responsible. When she obtains this loan, she will invest in the purchase of 5 bags of pea seeds, which cost approximately 550 soles each.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>681156</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>to purchase 5 bags of pea seeds.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>TARMA</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-11.419722 -75.690833</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2011-01-01T08:00:28Z</posted_date><loan_amount>900</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Marcelina </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-12-23T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>2500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>900</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-21T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-21T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2500</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>900</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>900</amount><local_amount>2500</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T11:32:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2525.4</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216549703</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2011-01-02T12:24:20Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-07-15T11:32:16Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>262030</id><name>Alexandra Dolores</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Alexandra de 31 años, es una joven emprendedora que está trabajando vendiendo productos Yanbal (empresa que ofrece a mujeres emprendedoras comenzar con sus ventas independientes) para ayudar a su esposo en los gastos del hogar. &#10;&#10;Vive en una zona periurbana llamada Paraíso y trabaja sola vendiendo los productos a sus vecinos, conocidos y recorriendo las calles.

She is still sad about his death, but the constant support she receives from her 3 children motivates her. She lives alone in her own home in the city of San Ramón (in the central Peruvian rainforest). The happiness she shows is a reflection of the support she receives from her children, who built their houses around her so they could look after her. Elena makes a living selling food, vegetables and fruits, from a little space set up in her home. She has been at this business for 4 years, but as this successful woman tells us, she also has a business selling coffee and honey. She gets these products in the city of Perene, where she travels constantly, and then sells them in the country’s capital. Elena’s strengths are surprising because she also grows potatoes in the city of Tarma, where she travels every harvest season. She is, however, aware of her advanced age, which is why she would like to buy a knitting machine to make sweaters to sell in the city of Huancayo and La Oroya. This is her eighth MFP loan, and she is happy belonging to her communal bank, which, in her own words, “is like family.” Once she gets the requested loan, she will use it to buy supplies for her grocery shop and if she makes any extra money she will spend it on growing potatoes.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>681177</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

C. tiene 40 años y vive con su esposo y su único hijo varón de 18 años en el barrio Lucero de la ciudad de Barranquilla. Ella tiene una tienda en la cual vende toda clase de víveres. El negocio era de su padre quien es actualmente pensionado de la policía nacional. Sus padres son oriundos del departamento del Tolima, en el centro del País y se trasladaron a la costa hace más de treinta años. La microempresaria desde niña ha estado vinculada al negocio de tienda. Su jornada laboral comienza a las 6 A.M. y termina a las 10 P.M. En horas de la noche, el esposo de la señora Yulima, que trabaja como mensajero, le colabora en atender los clientes. Este es el segundo crédito que ella tramita en la Fundación Mario Santo Domingo y planea utilizarlo en financiar la matrícula de su hijo en un instituto de educación técnica. El joven cursará cuarto semestre de electrónica. El promedio de ventas diarias es de $ 150.000 COP y el margen de utilidad es del 18%. Los fines de semana las ventas aumentan considerablemente porque la microempresaria coloca varias mesas y sillas en la terraza del negocio para que los vecinos del sector jueguen dominó y parqué mientras escuchan música y degustan una fría cerveza. La señora Yulima dice conocer tanto a sus clientes que casi siempre acierta en adivinar qué van a comprar.</es><en>Yulima S. C. is 40 years old and lives with her husband and 18 year-old son in Lucero neighborhood, in the city of Barranquilla.  She has a store where she sells all sorts of foodstuffs.  The business was her father&apos;s.  Her father is currently retired from the National Police Force.  Her parents are originally from Tolima department, in the center of the country.  They moved to the coast more than thirty years ago.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This small businesswoman has been linked to the store since she was a young girl.  Her work day starts at 6.00am and ends at 10.00pm.  During the evening hours Yulima&apos;s husband, who works as a messenger, helps her to serve her customers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is the second loan that Yulima has taken from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to use it to pay her son&apos;s registration fee for technical college.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Audrey J. created Visions CPR, First Aid &amp; EMT Training because she wanted to provide excellent training for medical professionals. Audrey has been working in the medical sector for over 30 years. She was originally a medic in the Army and then began training others in 1986. Her passion for teaching led her to open her own training center to ensure students receive top quality courses.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The Visions CPR courses give medical professionals the skills to save lives. Audrey’s loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana was used to replace old equipment, to pay three months’ rent on the facility, and to put money aside to pay instructors. There are many companies that offer training in the industry, so Audrey has to make Visions CPR stand out. She does this by buying state of the art equipment and by hiring professional paramedics to teach classes. The professional paramedics give her clients “off the books” knowledge that they may not receive at other training centers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Audrey opened her business in 2006 and has been working to improve it since then. Her advice to people opening new businesses is to find the best ways to advertise because advertising can be difficult. She also wants to tell new entrepreneurs that starting a business is not easy. She says, “You have to have a desire to do what you’re doing.” Audrey has proven that being patient and diligent, despite setbacks, will help a business succeed. She looks forward to continuing to provide medical professionals with the courses they need.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Feel free to check out her website:

Ambos tiene 2 hijos: Isabel, de 21 y Edwin, de 12 años de edad. En unión familiar ellos viven en su casa propia, ubicada en la ciudad de San Ramón (selva central peruana). Su alegría es notoria, ya que ella hace 10 años comenzó con la apertura de una tienda de comestibles, donde vende bebidas como cerveza, gaseosa, helados, y demás productos de primera necesidad, los cuales en todo este tiempo le proporcionaron buenas ganancias, tanto así que ahora en sociedad con su hija Isabel, comenzaron a incursionar en la apertura de un salón de belleza, en un lugar céntrico de la ciudad donde está segura le irá muy bien. Ahora Mirtha está pensando implementar su negocio con la compra de equipos de última generación para poder mantenerse las expectativas de sus clientes y crecer en el tiempo. Es el octavo crédito con MFP, y como socia de su banco comunal se siente feliz de poder integrar una asociación unida y sin mayores complicaciones. De obtener el crédito, podrá invertir en la compra de un mostrador de vidrio para su salón de belleza, que cuesta un promedio de S/. 680.00 nuevos soles, y el resto del dinero lo invertirá pen la compra de insumos necesarios para comenzar su negocio.  &#10;&#10;</es><en>Mirtha, 43, is married to Erwin, 48.  They have two children:  Isabel, 21, and Edwin, 12.  The family lives in their own house, located in the city of San Ramón (in Peru&apos;s central jungle).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mirtha is well-known for her happiness.  10 years ago she opened a grocery store, where she sold beer, soft drinks, ice cream and other staple goods.  The store gave her such a good income that now, with her daughter Isabel, she has begun to invest in opening a beauty salon in a central location in the city where she is sure she will do well.  Now Mirtha is thinking about supplying her business by purchasing the most modern equipment to meet her customers&apos; expectations and grow with time.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is her eighth loan with MFP, and as a member of her communal bank she is happy to be able to join such a united association that has no major problems.  When she receives the loan, she will be able to purchase for her beauty salon a glass counter, which costs on average 680 new soles.  Mirtha will invest the rest of the money in necessary supplies for starting the business.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>681230</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Beauty
