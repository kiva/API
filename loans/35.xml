They have their own tailor shop. Tailoring is their traditional work, which they learned from their forefathers. Their specialty is making custom-fitted dresses like the Kurta Sulwar pants and shirt, which are very popular in Nepal. They seek a $225 loan to buy raw materials for their tailoring work. &lt;p&gt;They have three sons and a daughter. Their older son works in a restaurant. Their second and younger sons are studying in grade 8 and 9, and their daughter is in grade 10. &lt;p&gt;Their economic condition makes it very hard to fulfill the basic needs of their family. So they need the loan to expand their business so as to earn more money to support their

Their family income is so low that it&apos;s difficult to fulfill their basic needs. They cannot provide better education for their children. So Mrs. M. and her husband opened the grocery shop 4 years ago. They seek $300 to buy grocery goods for the improvement of their shop.

She has done this for more than 20 years and she told us that thanks to this work, she and her husband, Sr. Mario Fernandez, were able to give their family a good education and even buy their own house.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her main customers are factories where they make chipas and bakeries in the neighborhood; they buy the ingredients—corn starch, cheese, vegetable oil, etc—from her daily.  The San Francisco de Caacupe neighborhood, where she lives, is a prominent area for chipas production which helps her sales, especially on the first days after every weekend.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In the months up to December 8, the demand for chipas production is incessant because of the Virgin of Caacupe celebration on that day.  Pilgrims from various parts of the country go to the city of Caacupe to attend the mass at the basilica there.  Sales are very good during this period and the neighborhood hums with activity as everyone in the neighborhood busies themselves making chipas for sale.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Sra. C. is asking for the loan to buy more corn starch, cheese, and maize so that she can meet the huge demand for her products.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;La señora Asunción, tiene 53 años, ella es  casada y tiene 5 hijos. Se dedica a la venta de materia prima para la elaboración de “chipas”. La chipa es una comida típica muy consumida en Paraguay, es parecido al pan y esta hecho a base de almidón, queso, leche, aceite vegetal, entre otros.  Ella se dedica a esta actividad más de veinte años, nos comenta que gracias a éste trabajo, ella y su marido, el señor Mario Fernández, pudieron brindarle a su familia una buena educación y hasta adquirieron su casa propia.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Sus principales clientes son las chiperías (fábricas de chipas) y panaderías de la zona, quiénes en forma diaria compran los productos que ellos venden como ser almidón, queso, aceite vegetal, etc. El barrio San Francisco de Caacupé donde ella reside, es una zona eminentemente productora de chipas, por lo que su movimiento de ventas es muy bueno especialmente en los días próximos al fin de semana.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;En los meses cercanos al  8 de Diciembre el movimiento de producción de chipas es incesante, ya que en esa fecha es el día de la Virgen de Caacupé y peregrinantes de diferentes partes del país van hasta la ciudad de Caacupé van a asistir a la misa que se realiza en la basílica.  Por ello la venta es muy buena en esa época y genera un dinamismo en el barrio ya que casi en todas las casas de la ciudad elaboran chipas para vender.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Desea el crédito para comprar más almidón, queso, maíz, porque la demanda de sus productos es bastante alta.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>57609</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Buy merchandise for sale.</use><location><country_code>PY</country_code><country>Paraguay</country><town>Caacupe</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-25.383333 -57.15</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>58</partner_id><posted_date>2007-09-02T19:20:03Z</posted_date><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Asunción</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-09-16T21:51:32Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>250</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-03T09:26:55Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-04T18:55:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>62563</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-03T10:29:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-04T18:55:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>75945</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-03T10:31:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-04T18:55:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>90793</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T10:22:10Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-04T18:55:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107511</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>82</amount><local_amount>82</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-04T18:55:46Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-04T18:55:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>82</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>108331</payment_id><comment>Prepayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-09-02T21:51:32Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-04T18:55:46Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>17131</id><name>Felicita</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>Felicita, 48, is married and has two children.

She began working as a seamstress more than 20 years ago, a skill that she learned from her mother who advised her and gave her an industrial sewing machine so that she could complete her initial orders.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She now works independently and owns 3 sewing machines.  When she has large numbers of orders, one of her daughters who has also learned the trade helps her.  Her daughter’s help speeds the work so that she can meet the requirements of her customers who want their orders delivered in as short a time as possible.  Thanks to honest hard work, she’s been able, with the help of her husband, to support her family and give her children good educations.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She has been thinking about expanding her small workroom so that can have all of her sewing machines in one place; for this, she’s asking for a $250 loan to expand her workroom.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Florentina tiene 38 años, ella está casada y tiene  5 hijos, se inició como costurera hace más de 20 años, oficio que lo adquirió gracias a las enseñanzas de su madre quien le orientó y le regalo una máquina de coser industrial, para realizar sus primeros trabajos de confección.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Actualmente ya trabaja de forma independiente, y posee 3 máquinas de coser. Cuando tiene gran cantidad de pedidos una de sus hijas le ayuda pues también ha aprendido el oficio,  de esa forma agiliza su trabajo para poder entregar todos los pedidos de sus clientes quienes en algunos casos desean que sus pedidos sean entregados en el menor tiempo posible.  Gracias a éste trabajo honesto y sacrificado pudo, junto con su marido, mantener a su familia  y además darle una educación digna.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Tiene pensado ampliar su pequeño salón de trabajo, de forma a que el espacio físico sea mayor y  poder tener todas sus máquinas en un mismo lugar, por ello solicita un crédito de $ 250 para invertirlos en la refacción y ampliación del salón.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>57614</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Manufacturing</activity><sector>Manufacturing</sector><use>Expand workroom for sewing business.</use><location><country_code>PY</country_code><country>Paraguay</country><town>Caacupe</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-25.383333 -57.15</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>58</partner_id><posted_date>2007-09-02T19:20:03Z</posted_date><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Florentina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-09-16T21:45:57Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>250</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-03T09:27:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-04T18:57:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>62565</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-03T10:29:54Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-04T18:57:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>75947</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-03T10:31:53Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-04T18:57:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>90795</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T10:22:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-04T18:57:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107513</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>82</amount><local_amount>82</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-04T18:57:40Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-04T18:57:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>82</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>108333</payment_id><comment>Prepayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-09-02T21:45:57Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-04T18:57:40Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>17134</id><name>Francisca</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>Mrs. Francisca is 44 years old, married, and has 4 children.

As part of the village bank, the four of them receive a loan together and the responsibility for repayment is on all four women.   They are asking a total loan of US$ 1200. Fortunata will use her share to buy more ingredients to prepare her &quot;moliente&quot;.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the midst of a bustling street market in Ayacucho, Peru, Fortunata can be found every day behind her cart selling “moliente,” hot herbal beverages. In addition to herbs and teas, she also has a small supply of homeopathic remedies. Her most popular product is a blend of “sábila,” a type of cactus leaves that she cuts open and then scrapes out the insides. She adds honey, and a variety of herbal teas. She tops this mixture off with a little hot water, and stirs well. It helps with digestion and is good for the immune system. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This drink as well as many others are very popular, and are sold for 1 Nuevo Sol (or about $0.30 U.S.) Fortunata&apos;s customers speak both Quechua, the indigenous language of Peru, and Spanish. Many are regulars, who come to Fortunata’s cart every day. Although hesitant to have her picture taken, Fortunata is a friendly woman who always engages her clients in conversation; they talk about her plants, market gossip, or their family lives. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Fortunata begins each day at 4:30 AM, in order to set up her stand by 5. She caters to a steady stream of customers until 9 a.m., before returning home to care for her four small children. She occasionally has time for a nap before returning to sell beverages, although a different variety, from 8 PM to midnight. Her husband helps out with the children when she is operating the cart, as well as helping prepare the plants she uses for tea each day before work. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Fortunata, Elisa, Sonia, and Hilda are looking forward to receiving this loan of US$1200, to be distributed among the four of them.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>57622</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>buy more ingredients to prepare her &quot;moliente&quot;</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Ayacucho</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-13.158333 -74.223889</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>70</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-30T16:40:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Fortunata</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-09-14T00:10:02Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>300</amount><local_amount>300</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-14T09:28:31Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-14T10:19:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>300</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>67474</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>300</amount><local_amount>300</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-14T10:29:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-14T10:19:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>300</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>81587</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>300</amount><local_amount>300</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-14T10:31:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-14T10:19:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>300</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>97179</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>300</amount><local_amount>300</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-14T10:15:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-14T10:19:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>300</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>115703</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-31T00:10:02Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-14T10:19:54Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>17137</id><name>María</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Maria is 51 years old, is married and has 2 children.

against poverty”. As part of the village bank, they receive a loan together and the responsibility for repayment rests on both of them.  They are asking for a total of US$ 1000; the loan will be divided between them.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In the local market in Ayacucho, Peru, past the flowers, raw meat, and dry goods, Margarita can be found chatting with customers and coworkers. Seven days a week, she sells live chickens and “cuy,” guinea pigs. The latter is a delicacy in Peru, prepared and eaten on special occasions. Because of the high altitude, grass is difficult to grow so raising cattle is almost impossible. This makes poultry and small animals the most practical source of protein. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Margarita says guinea pigs are the most popular item, and she has over 70 in cages in the market. She purchases all of her animals once a week at a livestock fair on the outskirts of town. She sells live animals, and also chickens and guinea pigs ready to cook. Guinea pigs are sold for US$ 2-3, depending on their size. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Margarita A. and her friend Zoraida Machao, who also works in the market, hope to expand their micro-businesses and increase their profit with this loan of US$ 1,000.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>57628</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Animal Sales</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>to buy more live animals to sell in the market</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Ayacucho</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-13.158333 -74.223889</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>70</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-30T16:40:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Margarita</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-09-14T02:20:57Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>250</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-14T09:28:36Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-14T10:19:57Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>250</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>67475</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>250</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-14T10:29:42Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-14T10:19:57Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>250</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>81588</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>250</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-14T10:31:07Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-14T10:19:57Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>250</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>97180</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>250</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-14T10:15:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-14T10:19:57Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>250</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>115704</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-31T02:20:57Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-14T10:19:57Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>17142</id><name>Abdul</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Abdul T. is the eldest of ten children.

She sells fruits, vegetables, sodas, firewood, groceries, cooking supplies, bread, and about anything you can think of.  She purchases the items fresh from the market once a week in bulk.  Without Victoria’s store and other surrounding stores, the locals would have to walk almost 30 minutes to the market to get a stick of butter.  The little grocery store is so convenient that parents can even send their 4-year-old children with a couple of “nuevos soles” in their pockets to purchase items for the household.  &lt;P&gt; Victoria works here with her husband, who translated her Quechuan answers to our questions into Spanish.  She and her husband have 4 children of their own.  Five years ago they adopted a boy from the local orphanage and just recently they have added a 6th member to the family from the same orphanage. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;This time, Victoria and her friend Carmen Rosa are asking for a loan of US$ 500.

R. lives in the Marcará district, Carhuaz Province, in Ancash Department. She is 36 years old. She became a widow 6 years ago and she has 3 children, to whom she must be both mother and father. &lt;p&gt;She sells chocho (which is a salad made with lupin beans, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and condiments) from the door of the house where she lives. Five years ago, she heard there was an institution that gave loans to women. She learned about how Manuela Ramos works and decided to become involved in the “Madres Marcarinas” Communal Bank. &lt;p&gt;The loan for S/. 1,500.00 (approximately $475.00) that she is requesting will be used to buy ingredients for her business. She says that the loans she has received in the past have helped her business a lot. It has grown, and thanks to it, she can educate her children, pay the rent for her house, and it allows her to live better. &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;La Señora  Lonia  Margarita S.

They own a small &quot;chipas&quot; factory at their home. Mrs. Maria, with the help of one of her sisters, is in charge of the production. The &quot;chipa&quot; is a typical Paraguayan food; it is similar to bread and consists of dough, cheese, milk, vegetable oil, and other ingredients.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Her husband Cirilo is in charge of the sales. He travels every day to the city of Clorinda, Argentina (the neighboring country) to sell his tasty products. He has a well-known stand in this city, where he has been working for about 25 years now.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They are requesting a loan to enlarge the roof of their barn which will give them more space to produce the chipas. Thanks to this business, they have been able to buy their own home as well as pay for the studies of their two children, who at this moment are enrolled at the university.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated by Ramón F.

La chipa es una comida típica muy consumida en Paraguay, es parecido al pan y esta hecho a base de almidón, queso, leche, aceite vegetal, entre otros.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Su marido Cirilo es el encargado de las ventas, el viaja todos los días hasta  la Ciudad de Clorinda – Argentina (país que limita con Paraguay) para vender sus ricos productos ya que tiene su puesto de venta en esa ciudad y que ya es bastante conocido en el lugar ya que lleva trabajando unos 25 años en esa zona.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Están solicitando el préstamo para ampliar el techo de su galpón y así tener mayor comodidad para elaborar y producir las chipas.

He and his family live in the village of Saatli in the south-central flat area of Azerbaijan in the Caucasus region.&#13;&#10;Every day, Murad goes to his shop to sell goods. However the turnover is very low, because having so big a family (10 people) he is not able to save enough money to  invest in his business, once he has paid for his family&apos;s basic living expenses.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Therefore, Murad has decided to request a $600 loan from Normicro Saatli branch to enable him to purchase a greater variety of goods for his shop and increase the shop&apos;s daily turnover. It makes good business sense for him to repay this loan in small monthly instalments. This arrangement will allow him to maintain a steady monthly income as well as save some money each month which he can use to invest in his business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>57668</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

She own a small grocery store and earns extra income selling milk and home-made cheese.  One of her children helps her with the new business because revenue from milk sales is notably growing.  She&apos;s had her grocery store for more than 18 years, through ups and downs, through periods when she couldn&apos;t immediately stock it because of other large expenses that had to be covered first.  She says that in the last few months, competition has increased because several supermarkets have opened in the area.  Even so, she provides everyday products like sugar, pasta, milk, flour, etc. to neighborhood families.  A large percentage of her revenues comes from the sale of milk and home-made cheese.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She would like to better stock her grocery store with soft drinks, milk products and beer as there&apos;s a lot of demand for those products.  She&apos;s asking for a $250 loan to buy those kinds of supplies.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Marina tiene 56 años, ella es casada y tiene 3 hijos, posee una despensa, y como actividad adicional tiene  venta de leche y elaboración de queso, uno de sus hijos es el que ayuda en el negocio, ya que la venta de leche le genera un ingreso más rápido e interesante. Su despensa lo tiene ya hace más de 18 años con sus altos y bajos, ya que en algunas oportunidades tuvo grandes gastos que cubrir y no podía surtir su despensa inmediatamente.&#13;&#10;Comenta que en estos últimos meses, la competencia ha aumentado pues se han abierto varios supermercados en la zona, no obstante ella provee a las familias de productos de primera necesidad como azúcar, fideos, leche, harina, etc. Un gran porcentaje de los ingresos se genera de la venta de leche y elaboración de queso.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ella desea surtir más su despensa y desea comprar gaseosas, lácteos y cerveza pues tiene bastante demanda de estos productos, para ello solicita un crédito de $ 250 para comprar dichos productos.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>57707</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

S. belongs to the “Perlas de Pucallpa” Communal Bank of Jr. Pachitea from the town of Ollada, in the Calleria District, in Ucayali department. &lt;p&gt;Sara is 44 years old and is a single mother with 5 children. When her husband abandoned the family, he left them with a lot of debt and she and her children had to work. The first loan she requested from the Movimiento Manuela Ramos was for S/. 300.00 (approximately $94.00). They decided to buy snack foods and sodas with that money. Over time they decided to incorporate food sales, for which they requested a loan of S/. 1,500.00 (approximately $475.00), also from Manuela Ramos.&lt;p&gt;Now the family works together to tend the business. They wake up at 4:00am and each has their obligations, from cleaning the store to the preparation of the food to serving the customers. However, they don’t neglect their studies. At 6:00pm they all meet to go over what went wrong and what went wrong in the business that day. In this way, the continue with more enthusiasm the following day.&lt;p&gt;The requested loan will be used to improve the store, which is build of wood. They need to paint the exterior so that it will be more visible. Additionally, the kitchen requires maintenance and they need to buy 3 large cooking pots and some tables. Sara is very happy to have paid off her debts. Above all, she and her family are united and they are getting ahead.&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Sara R. S. pertenece al Banco Comunal &quot;Perlas de Pucallpa&quot; del Jr. Pachitea del sector de la Ollada en el Distrito de Calleria del Departamento de Ucayali. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sara tiene 44 años, madre soltera con 5 hijos, desde que el padre de sus hijos la abandonó dejándoles muchas deudas, ella y sus hijos tuvieron que trabajar, solicitó un primer préstamo S/. 300 (US$ 94.00 aprox.) a Manuela Ramos, con ese dinero deciden vender golosinas y gaseosas, pero con el transcurrir del tiempo deciden incorporar la venta de comida, para lo cual solicitaron a Manuela Ramos un préstamo de S/. 1,500 (US$ 475.00 Aprox.). &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ahora conjuntamente con sus hijos atienden este negocio, se levantan a las 4.00 am. y cada uno ya tienen sus obligaciones, desde la limpieza del local hasta la preparación  del alimento y atención al cliente. Por cierto, no descuidan sus estudios. A las 6.00 pm se reúnen para ver los errores o aciertos del negocio y así seguir con mas animo el día siguiente.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;El préstamo solicitado será para mejorar su local que es de madera y necesita pintar la parte de afuera para tener mejor visión, además su cocina necesita  mantenimiento y requiere comprar  3 ollas y un juego de mesas. Ella esta muy contenta de haber cancelado las deudas pendientes y sobre todo tiene a sus hijos unidos y  están saliendo adelante.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>475</funded_amount><paid_amount>475</paid_amount><image><id>57737</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>For maintenance of kitchen equipment and the building.

H. is 52 years old and she belongs to the “Santa Barbara” Communal Bank. She lives in the Calleria District. She is separated from her husband and has 6 children. She currently sells medicinal plants from the area, such as rue, basil, and aloe. After Blanca separated from her husband, she found herself in a difficult economic situation. When she saw that it is custom in the region to use plants for medicines and also for some rituals, she decided to get into this business, but she didn’t have enough capital. The Movimiento Manuela Ramos gave her the opportunity to invest in this. It was four years ago that she began with a small amount of capital, S/. 300.00 (approximately $94.00). Her current request is for approx S/. 2,000.00 ($625.00). &lt;p&gt;She will use the money to buy more medicinal plants at whole-sale price.

She is married and has three daughters who are 20, 16, and 14 years old.  Her husband works in an agro-industrial company as a veterinarian. One of her daughters help her in her business, which she started because she enjoys sales.  While she has the extra income to live on, she needs it for her all her children&apos;s tuition costs.  The reason she started her business was so that she could send her children to college.   She started her business 6 years ago, selling clothes amongst neighbors and close friends and acquaintances.  It took off well and she increased the range of items to sell like perfumes, women&apos;s sandals and accessories, and her customer base has increased.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Teresita is seeking a loan of $925 to buy more fashionable clothes, perfumes, sandals, and accessories to stock up her business and to better attend her customers.  She will repay the loan in 6 months.  She and her family thank you for giving your support to grow and develop her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Volunteer.  &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Teresita es una mujer trabajadora, cumplida y muy responsable, ella esta casada y tiene tres hijas de 20, 16 y 14 años de edad respectivamente, su esposo trabaja en una empresa agro industrial como médico veterinario. Una de sus hijas le ayuda en el negocio, el cual empezó por que le gustan mucho las ventas y de esta manera también podía tener un ingreso extra para su hogar, ya que el gasto es elevado por que todas sus hijas están estudiando y necesitan este ingreso para que puedan terminar sus estudios, esto es el motivo más grande que la llevo a iniciar su negocio ya que desea que todas sus hijas tengan estudios universitarios. Ella empezó hace 6 años con su negocio vendiendo ropa entre sus vecinas y amistades y le comenzó a ir muy bien, entonces amplio su gama de productos e incursionó en la venta de perfumes, sandalias para dama y accesorios también, así su clientela se ha incrementado. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Teresita está solicitando un préstamo por la cantidad de US $ 925 para comprar ropa de temporada, perfumes, sandalias y accesorios para surtir más su negocio y así atender mejor a sus clientes, ofreciendo pagar el préstamo en 6 meses.

sales of such. In the case of the &quot;pacas&quot;, we are talking of even higher margins than those usually found in the business, as these are pressed bundles of new and used clothing that are sent to poor countries as assistance, but end up being traded in an &quot;open&quot; market in this country. The business is even more profitable when you buy unopened bundles, as the element of surprise makes the initial sales price lower for lack of real knowledge of what&apos;s in the bundle. &lt;P&gt;Usually the bundles are made up of clothing which is much more appreciated in the market than the real price paid for the unopened bundle. (Sometimes one can get &apos;burnt&apos; in the process, but this is a rare occasion, and usually one can at least &apos;break even&apos; under the most negative clothing bundle conditions.) &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Even though Francisca is a young mother, she now needs to take care of her offspring, and therefore is going to start out in this business, which she feels is the most lucrative she can develop.

X., 29, is a member of a women&apos;s loan group where every one of the women weaves &lt;i&gt;huipiles&lt;/i&gt;, the traditional Mayan women&apos;s top. In this village they weave the &lt;i&gt;huipil&lt;/i&gt; of relatively simple cloth, but then embroider it richly.  Irma can make 2 &lt;i&gt;huipiles&lt;/i&gt; in 15 days, and then she sells them in the market in Chimaltenango for about US$65 each.  She&apos;ll invest this loan, as she did the previous one, in the yarn she needs for weaving and in embroidery thread. She says that having a bit of capital via the loan just makes things a little easier – it&apos;s not a big problem trying to get money together to buy yarn, which used to be the case. In fact, she still has a little left from her last loan, which is completely paid off. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Irma&apos;s dream is to build a house and buy some land. She currently spends about $200/year to rent a little 20 by 40 meter plot where she grows corn, the staple food of the people here. Buying a 20 by 20 meter plot would cost her about $2000. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Irma, like several other women in her village, reports that the children under age 2 are very regularly sick, with fevers, headaches, and stomach aches. It seems to clear up a bit when they get to age two, but it&apos;s a challenge that all the young families here seem to face.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Here is a video of the women of Irma&apos;s group at their loan meeting.

Marroquin, 26, weaves the huipiles which are in such demand in the highlands of Guatemala. Because women here still wear the traditional costumes, they all need huipiles, and Isabel is one of the hundreds or thousands of women that weave them by hand. She takes the bus ride to the market in Chimaltenango every 15 days or so to sell the five huipiles that she&apos;s woven and embroidered. They sell for about US$28/each. Her loan will be invested immediately in yarn to make more huipiles. Even though this is her first loan ever in her life, she&apos;s not afraid, because she knows she can earn the money to pay it back.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Isabel is single and has one little boy who&apos;s just a year old. Her dream is to just get a little ahead a little at a time. She has great educational goals for her son Isaias, partly because she dropped out after just one year of primary school. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here is a video of the women of Isabel&apos;s group at their loan meeting.

She can make a profit of some US$ 0.75 per chicken; normally, she can sell some 300 chickens a month. Thus she makes an average of some US$ 225 a month, whereas she needs to make around $550 (twice what she now makes) in order to meet the standard cost of living for a family in her area today. &lt;P&gt;Given an eager and acceptable market, this loan can supply Eleuteria with precisely what she would need in order to balance out her requirements to meet normal cost of living expenses.

She will buy the hand-woven material from other women in her village and then hand embroider flowers and through out the blouse. Her technique of embroidering these fabrics is highly specialized and different from that of her neighbors – she actually apprenticed to another master embroiderer to learn the technique.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The current piece she is creating incorporates 33 different Mayan symbols which are called hieroglyphs. The Maya hieroglyphics were the writing system of the pre-Columbian civilization. It will take her 15 days to create the exquisite finished blouse and  she will sell it for about US$85. She also makes a less expensive blouse that has embroidered flowers throughout the top part of the blouse and sells for about $35. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Kelin is married and has a 3-year-old. Her husband works in the fields. Her biggest goal, which she is passionate about, is to ensure that her child must receive an education to become a professional, escaping the limited opportunities her husband endures. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her health is not good and like so many other women and children in her village, she suffers from many ailments during the six-month rainy season. Malnutrition is a factor in this community. The women all breast feed and most of the children under two years old are underweight and therefore get hit the hardest with illness. Many of the women are looking for resources to obtain vitamins for their babies.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here is a video of the women of Kelin&apos;s group at their loan meeting.

She says her main difficulty is having to buy the flour, oils, and seeds she uses for bread making. However, she states that  she now needs a more modern oven to bake her bread. She&apos;s presently using an oven fueled by wood. She says that she wants to have an alternative to using fuel which she knows is wasting trees. &lt;P&gt;When we sat down to do some math relative to the cost of energy, we found that for her, wood is cost-effective, plus the fact that wood as a source of cooking heat is unbeatable with respect to flavor of the final product!  Thus we concluded that if she could buy more flour and other cooking needs, she might have just the right combination of cost and product effectiveness.  Hence, Ramona is &apos;counting the hours&apos; until she can get  her loan, so as to stop &quot;beating around the bush&quot; to make a living!</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>57816</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Bakery</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>baking bread for her community</use><location><country_code>DO</country_code><country>Dominican Republic</country><town>Yamasa</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>18.783333 -70.05</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>66</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-31T18:07:30Z</posted_date><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ramona</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-09-14T18:31:51Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>300</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-14T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-14T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-14T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-14T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-03-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-14T09:28:13Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-14T10:07:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>67467</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-14T10:29:11Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-14T10:07:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>81575</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-14T10:30:32Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-14T10:07:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>97164</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-14T10:15:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-14T10:07:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>115687</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-14T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-14T10:07:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>135364</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2008-03-14T10:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-14T10:07:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>157879</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-31T18:31:51Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-03-14T10:07:23Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>17200</id><name>Matilde</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Matilde M.

T. is 21 and along with the rest of her women&apos;s group, weaves &lt;i&gt;huipiles&lt;/i&gt;, the traditional women&apos;s blouse of highland Guatemala. She can weave and then embroider four of them in a 15-day period, and then she sells them in the market in Chimaltenango for about US$70 each.  This will be her second loan with Friendship Bridge, and she says that having the capital lets her make just a little progress on the economic front, making just a little more profit, since she doesn&apos;t have to struggle so to save up to purchase the yarn.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Paulina&apos;s group, the &quot;Flor de Pascua&quot;, or &quot;Easter Flower&quot; group, takes their loan commitment very seriously. They receive their loans as a group and are jointly accountable for them. They&apos;re very proud of their repayment record. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Paulina, like several other women in her village, reports that the children under age 2 are very regularly sick, with fevers, headaches, and stomach aches. It seems to clear up a bit when they get to age two, but it&apos;s a challenge that all the young families here seem to face. Paulina&apos;s theory is that they are lacking some type of vitamins, but she is not sure what it might be.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here is a video of the women of Paulina&apos;s group at their loan meeting. The entire group, without exception, weaves and embroiders &lt;i&gt;huipiles&lt;/i&gt;, and you can see them here working away while the loan terms and obligations are being explained.&lt;br/&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot;

She lives with her husband and his three sisters.  Mrs. Ferry has enthusiastically run a laundry business for about one year.  This would now be the second loan period.  When it&apos;s busy, she averages ten customers a day.  Every customer brings 3 kilograms.  For each kilogram, Ibu Ferry charges Rp. 10,000.  Thus every day, Ms. Ferry receives about Rp. 300,000.  When it&apos;s quiet, she only serves one to three customers.  The loan of Rp. 700,000 she will use to increase the possibility of adding more customers.  This will allow her to increase the income so that she can add to the family income.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Indonesian by Andrew Goss, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ibu Ferry V. tinggal di Jl. Gurita no. 32 Sesetan, Denpasar Selatan. Dia tinggal bersama dengan suami dan tiga putrinya. Ibu Ferry mulai menekuni bisnis laundry ini selama kurang lebih satu tahun. Sekarang merupakan periode pinjaman kedua. Kalau sedang ramai setiap harinya rata -rata dapat sampai dengan 10 pelanggan. Setiap pelanggan membawa 3 kg. Setiap kg Ibu Ferry menghargainya sebesar Rp 10.000,00. Jadi Setiap hari pendapatannya sekitar Rp 300.000,00. Apabila sedang sepi dia hanya akan melayani satu sampai tiga pelanggan. Pinjaman sebesar Rp 700.000,00 dia harapkan dapat semakin memungkinkan dia untuk mencari semakin banyak pelanggan. Sehingga itu akan menambah penghasilannya untuk menambah penghasilan keluarga.</id></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>75</funded_amount><paid_amount>75</paid_amount><image><id>57834</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Laundry</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Purchase detergent, bleach and scent.

Hal ini disebabkan putrinya yang ketiga masih bayi. Bisnis ini sudah ditekuninya selama satu tahun. Pinjaman yang ada dia gunakan untuk menambah modal untuk pembelian deterjen, pembersih dan pewangi yang dia butuhkan. Setiap harinya dia dapat memperoleh antara Rp 30.000,00 ( 1pelanggan) - Rp 300.000,00 (10 pelanggan). Modal tersebut juga membantu dia untuk dapat menambah pelanggan.

She exhibited them herself on her house&apos;s patio.  She goes to Caacupe on the weekends, where she receives plenty of visitors and therefore makes the biggest sales. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She wishes to obtain this loan to be able to purchase more ornament variety - such as decorative figures ( elves, flowers, animals, etc).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Yael Schwartzman, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; La señora Fermina tiene 47 años, ella está casada y tiene 3 hijos, se  dedica a la venta de artesanías hace ya  más de 25 años.

Francisca is 52 years old.  She is married and has 5 children.  Three of them still live at home and are going to school.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She makes homemade jam and all sorts of homemady sweets (candy) traditional to the area.  She says that she inherited her talent at making sweets from one of her aunts who taught her everything she knows since she helped her aunt for many years until she decided to go on her own.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Sra. Francisca has been making and selling candy for the past 25 years.  Some of the candy flavors are guayaba, apple and whatever fruit that&apos;s in season.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She works from home.  She already has all the ingredients/supplies necessary to do her work.  She makes candy twice a week.  Her primary clients are the ones at the local market located in the city of San Lorenzo which is about 45 Km from Caacupe.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Sra. Francisca tells us that with the previous loans she has received from Fundacion Paraguaya (Paraguay Foundation), she has been able to buy the main ingredients and main supplies for her business.  She is hoping to display and sell her candy at the local arts/crafts expositions in the cities of Altos, Tobati and Aregua which are located about one hour away from Caacupe.  This is why she is requesting a loan in the amount of $100 USD so that she can purchase a big table, a chair and some sort of sunshade in order to go to these expositions.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Carolina Zelaya-Kronlund, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora Francisca tiene 52 años, está casada y tiene 5 hijos de los cuales tres de ellos aun viven con ella y van al colegio.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ella se dedica a la elaboración y producción de dulces (mermeladas) caseros, nos comenta que el arte de elaborar dulces artesanales lo adquirió de una tía quien le enseño las técnicas de elaborado y de quien fue ayudante por varios años hasta que decidió independizarse.&#13;&#10; Ya van 25 años desde que Francisca trabaja de forma independiente vendiendo sus dulces, algunos de los sabores que podemos citar tenemos dulce de frutilla, guayaba, manzana y frutas de estación. &#13;&#10; Trabaja en su propia casa, ella cuenta con todos los elementos necesarios para la elaboración de los mismos. Prepara sus dulces dos veces por semana y sus principales clientes son los negocios ubicados en el mercado de San Lorenzo, ciudad distante a unos 45 Km de Caacupé.&#13;&#10;Francisca, comenta que los préstamos que le otorgo la Fundación Paraguaya con anterioridad le han sido de mucha ayuda ya que de esa forma obtuvo capital para comprar las materias prima y los elementos necesarios.&#13;&#10;Tiene en proyecto mostrar sus productos en las exposiciones artesanales en las ciudades de Altos, Tobatí y Areguá, las mismas quedan a menos de una hora de la ciudad de Caacupé.; para ello solicita el

She specializes in a type of handicraft called &quot;aho poi&quot;, which is hand stitched embroidery for blouses, pants and dresses.  It is a typical handicraft of Paraguay and many women who practice it pass on their knowledge and technique from generation to generation.   Like the majoriy of women, Josefina learned how to do this from her mother, who taught her everything she knew. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Josefina attends handicraft expositions in different cities, bringing along her products to sell.  In addition to the &quot;aho poi&quot;, she also does sewing by request, things such as dresses, pants, blouses, etc.    With this, she helps her husband maintain the house and the monthly bills of the family.  Two of their children are already in school so the costs have increased.  With the loan of $200, she would like to buy fabrics and thread in greater quantity and more colors, in this way she can save costs by getting better discounts.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Josefina tiene 34 años, está casada y tiene 3 hijos, ella es especialista en la confección de  ropa de todo tipo de modelos de la línea de “aho poi”. El aho poi es un bordado hecho a mano con diferentes motivos y realizados en camisas, pantalones vestidos, etc., es un trabajo típico de Paraguay y muchas mujeres artesanas lo realizan y pasan sus conocimientos de la técnica de generación en generación.&#13;&#10;Como la mayoría de las mujeres ella adquirió el oficio como herencia de su madre, quien le enseño todo lo que sabe. La señora Josefina, siempre asiste a  exposiciones de artesanías en diferentes ciudades, llevando así su arte y vendiendo sus productos. Además del aho poi, ella también realiza costuras bajo pedido, como vestidos, pantalones, camisas, etc. &#13;&#10;Con esto Josefina ayuda a su marido a mantener la casa y los gastos de la familia ya que sus dos hijos están en la escuela y por ende los gastos son más elevados. Tiene pensado hacerse en adquirir en mayor cantidad hilos y telas en cantidad y diferentes colores, de forma ahorrar costo obteniendo importantes descuentos; para ello solicita el crédito de $

Ella realiza vestidos de novias, quinceañeras, camisas, uniformes, etc. &#13;&#10;Ella desea que en el país existan más fuentes de trabajo para que la situación económica de todos sea más estable de esta forma evitar que la gente emigre a otros países en busca de trabajo, ya que muchos de sus clientes emigraron a otros países.&#13;&#10;En los últimos meses ha recibido una gran cantidad de trabajos, para poder cumplir con todos desea adquirir telas, hilos, botones y cierres al por mayor ya que comprando en grandes cantidades obtiene mejores descuentos de sus proveedores. Para realizar estas compras, Lilian, solicita un crédito de $ 200.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes

I currently need more supplies because the busy season is approaching and sales will increase considerably.  Thanks to this business, our children are able to go to school.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Hola Juana  Francisca,

She&apos;s had a grocery store in her home for more than 30 years.   She opened the store in her own house and had ups and downs in her business.  In 1995, she had to shut down her store because of a economic crisis going on in her country.  Thanks to her siblings&apos; and husband&apos;s help, she was able to newly rebuild her store 4 years later.  Following this line, she sells basic goods like fruits, vegetables, milk, flour, noodles, etc.  Because of the store, she can contribute her earnings to her home. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;There was a strong emigration and many of her customer left for Spain for better opportunities for work - Luciana was left worried.  However, she continued to struggle and gave better attention to her new customers.  She wishes to continue running her store so her customer can meet their needs by going to her store without going to larger commercial centers.  She is seeking $500 to invest in buying merchandise like milk, meat, beer, gasoline, wine, etc. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora Luciana tiene 59 años, ella es casada y tiene 4 hijos todos mayores de edad. Ella tiene una despensa en su casa desde hace más de  30 años.&#13;&#10;El almacén lo abrió en su casa propia, nos cuenta que ha tenido buenos y malos momentos, en el año 95 ella tuvo que cerrar su almacén debido a la gran crisis económica que atravesaba el país en ese momento. Gracias a la ayuda de sus hijos y marido, nuevamente pudo habilitar su despensa 4 años más tarde. En la misma ofrece productos de primera necesidad como frutas, verduras, leche, harina, fideos, etc. Gracias a su despensa puede aportar con los ingresos a la casa. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Debido a la fuerte emigración, Luciana, se ve preocupada pues muchos de sus clientes ya emigraron a España para buscar mejores oportunidades de trabajo; no obstante, ella sigue luchando y dando la mejor atención para ganar nuevos clientes.&#13;&#10;Ella desea seguir surtiendo su despensa de modo a que sus clientes puedan satisfacer sus necesidades de compra en su negocio sin tener que ir a centros comerciales más grandes; solicita $ 500 para invertirlos en la compra de leche, carne, cerveza, gaseosas, vino, etc.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>57945</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

Her husband is a carpenter and they live in a house which took a lot of work to build.   Maria is a very enterprising woman, and because she and her husband come from humble families, Maria decided to start her own business in order to help her husband with the household costs.  She decided to open a kiosk, starting from very little, initially selling only drinks and ice cream, and later, after some time had passed and she generated more profits, the business grew to include more products to sell such as fruits and bread and sodas.   Maria is a well respected woman in her community for her leadership characteristics, and she&apos;s already started a commission in her neighborhood with the objective of improving the streets.  Maria would like to continue growing her business and diversifying her sales, so she is requesting this loan to buy merchandise such as vegetables, crackers, dairy products, frozen foods, etc.  for her grocery store. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora María tiene 39 años, está casada y tiene 4 hijos, todos son aún pequeños y están en edad escolar. Su marido es carpintero y viven todos juntos en una casa que con mucho esfuerzo lograron construir.&#13;&#10; Ella es una mujer muy emprendedora, y debido a que ella y su marido provienen de familias humildes, María decidió montar su propio negocio para ayudar a su marido con los ingresos de la casa. Fue así que decidió abrir un kiosco; empezó el negocio desde muy abajo ya que en  principio solo vendía bebidas y helados luego con el correr del tiempo y con las ganancias que generaba el negocio fue ampliándose e incorporando nuevos productos para la venta.&#13;&#10;Vende diferentes tipos de productos, como golosinas, gaseosas, frutas, pan, etc.  María es una señora muy respetada en su comunidad por su carácter de líder,  ya que integra una comisión de su barrio con el objetivo de mejorar las calles del barrio.&#13;&#10;Ella desea seguir progresando y diversificar sus ventas, por lo que solicita el crédito para comprar más mercaderías como verduras, productos enlatados, galletitas, golosinas, lácteos, etc.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes

They are the parents of a daughter who is 13 years old and a student of the 8th grade. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Señor Juan began this activity eleven years ago. Since then he had been working abroad so he could save up capital, and upon his return he invested it to begin his own carpentry shop. His carpentry shop has been growing more and more each day giving him a collection of top-level machinery and an expansion on his work garage, all thanks to the quality of his products and his good service. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Don Juan is requesting a loan to purchase merchandise like different types of wood, because with more raw materials he will be able to make a greater variety of furniture models, increase his stock of merchandise, and in this way offer top-quality furniture to his clients.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva volunteer &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Don Juan A. de 61 años de edad, está felizmente casado con la Sra.

Cabe mencionar que su carpinteria va creciendo cada día más con su stock de maquinarias de primer nivel y la ampliación de su galpón, gracias a la calidad de sus productos y su buen

They are the proud parents of Carlos N., 2 years old. Juan began working 15 years ago in an automobile electronics branch, a skill that he learned when he was only 16 years old. He worked in the body shop as an assistant. He continues to work in a body shop, however not as a helper now but rather as the owner. With much sacrifice and effort he was able to obtain his own shop beginning 6 years ago. Today he has many faithful clients due to the fact that he not only offers good service and good products, but also he does it in a personalized way. &lt;p&gt;Juan’s dream is to expand his business and with this be able to provide the best for his family and the best education for his son. &lt;p&gt;He asks for credit in order to be able to expand his business so that he can provide his customers with greater convenience and ease in their day to day activities. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Pendleton, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;El Sr. Juan N. de 31 años de edad, está felizmente casado con la Sra.

She is on her fifth loan and she is still running her Samoan oil business together with an additional business of weaving fine mats. &lt;p&gt;Although the loan seems big compared to the business, Puaaelo, as mentioned before, also weaves and sells fine mats at very high prices. These fine mats are more sellable in times of funerals, weddings and other events. So when people are in need, they buy these fine mats from her. The cost of 20 inches of fine matting is usually two thousand to two thousand and fifty dollars for one. So if she can sell two to three fine mats a month, that will be more income for her.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>58002</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Crafts</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>“Buy

Giyas sells beef in the Saatli town, while his son grazes cattle.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;However, the income from  their four cows is too low to support the family and another cow would help their financial situation.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Alla is a busy entrepreneur from Zaporoshye, Ukraine. She runs two kiosks where she sells a nice selection of women’s dresses and hats. Married with two children, Alla started her business not long after graduating from college. One of her biggest motivations for operating her business is to provide for the needs of her children.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has had one kiosk for several years at a great location at a market near a train station and manufacturing plant. The market is open late and stays open on weekends, allowing vendors there to earn extra income.

She had difficulty paying for medication, clothes, school etc. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;             In 2005, after borrowing $500 from Normicro, Arzu was able to expand her business, increase her profits and improve her family&apos;s livelihood.  The second loan she borrowed was for $850 which she used to expanded her shop and increase the amount of goods sold.&#13;&#10;             &#13;&#10;Arzu needs a $1200 loan in order to further develop her business.  She wants to buy other types of goods and start selling shoes to increase her profits and improve her family’s living conditions.  She would use this additional income to educate her children.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>58030</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

She tells us that, because of economic problems and the lack of well-paying jobs, 2 of her daughters had to emigrate to Spain to improve their income and in that way help their family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Due to economic problems and the illness of her husband, Gregoria had to sell her house and practically all the assets that the couple had, in order to travel with her entire family to Argentina so that her husband could follow a course of medical treatment in that country, a treatment which, sadly, did not give results and her husband passed away after some time, five years ago. With the blows life was giving her at that time, and in a foreign country, she saw the necessity of returning to Paraguay, to start all over again from zero.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She started out selling merchandise in the street. At that time she had just one big bag which she carried on her back, going from house to house offering her products. In this way she made working capital and, little by little, with much sacrifice, her business kept growing. She had the chance to buy a new house and in that way raise her 5 children and offer them a good education. Today, she already has a good quantity of customers, and thanks to her effort and the support of her children, she is able to open a small business inside her own home.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With the loan she is requesting, she plans to expand her stock of merchandise. She needs to buy more clothing, footwear, and gloves, and in that way augment her economic income.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(Translated from the Spanish by Naomi Johnson, Kiva volunteer)&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;La señora Gregoria tiene 44 años ,  es viuda y  tiene 5 hijos de los cuales dos son varones y tres mujeres, nos cuenta que por problemas económicos y por falta de trabajo con una buena remuneracion 2 de sus hijas tuvo la necesidad de emigrar a España para de esta forma mejorar sus ingresos y asi poder ayudar a su familia .&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Por problemas económicos y enfermedad de su esposo, Gregoria, tuvo que vender su casa y prácticamente todos los bienes que la pareja tenia en ese momento para viajar con toda su familia a la Argentina para que su esposo siga en ese país un tratamiento médico, tratamiento que lastimosamente no dio resultado y  su esposo falleció luego de un tiempo, de eso ya hace 5 años. Con los golpes que la vida en ese momento le estaba dando y en un país extranjero se vio con la necesidad de volver al Paraguay para de esta forma volver a empezar todo de cero.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Empezo vendiendo mercaderias por las calles, en ese entonces contaba con un solo bolson que llevaba sobre su espalda y llegaba casa por  casa a ofrecer sus productos, asi de fue haciendo de capital operativo y poco a poco con mucho sacrificio fue acrecentando su negocio y se volvio a comprar una nueva casa y asi pudo criar a sus 5 hijos y ofrecerles una buena educaion. Actualmente ya cuenta con una buena cantidad de clientela y gracias a su esfuerzo y al apoyo de sus hijos puedo abrir un pequeño negocio dentro de su propia casa.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Con el crédito que solicita piensa en ampliar su stock de mercaderias, necesita comprar mas ropas, calzados, medias, guantes,  para de esta forma poder  aumentar sus ingresos

She comes from a very humble family and had to work from a young age.

She is married and her husband&apos;s name is Ladislao Cespedes.  They have 5 children and they all go to school which is about 8 blocks from their home.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She makes chipas and she sells them by travelling all around the neighborhoods in different cities.  Chipa is a traditional food and very popular in Paraguay.  It&apos;s similar to bread and it&apos;s made out of starch, cheese, milk, vegetable oil, etc.  She has a small shop in her home where she makes her chipas and her family help her make around 200 chipas a day.  The cities where she makes most of her money are San Lorenzo and Fernando de la Mora which are located one hour away from Caacupe.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Marta tells us that with this job, she and her husband have been able to have a roof over their head, provide food for their family and provide an education to their children.  Lately sales have been low and to be able to sell all her chipas, Marta has to walk all around town until she sells all her chipas because if she doesn&apos;t sell them then she doesn&apos;t make money.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She also tells us that she went to many different lending institutions to try to get a loan, but nobody was willing to let her borrow money since she doesn&apos;t have many references/credentials.  Fundacion Paraguaya was the only one who helped her to get a loan .  Thanks to that loan she was able to build a brick oven because previously she was renting her neighbor&apos;s brick oven to make her chipas.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;At this time she is requesting a loan to purchase main ingredients such as eggs, milk, starch and cheese.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Carolina Zelaya-Kronlund, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora Marta, tiene 41 años, ella es casada, su marido se llama Ladislao Céspedes y tienen 5 hijos; todos van a la escuela que queda a 8 cuadras de su domicilio.&#13;&#10;Ella elabora y vende chipas de forma ambulante, recorriendo barrios de diferentes ciudades. La chipa es una comida típica muy consumida en Paraguay, es parecido al pan y está hecho a base de almidón, queso, leche, aceite vegetal, entre otros. Posee una pequeña fábrica de chipa en su domicilio que con la ayuda de sus hijos y su marido realizan la producción de 200 chipas por día, su zona de mayor venta son las ciudades de San Lorenzo y Fernando de la Mora que quedan a 1 hora de la ciudad de Caacupé.&#13;&#10;Comenta Marta, que con este trabajo ella y su marido pudieron hacerse de una casa, y que aunque es pequeña, sirve para dar techo, comida, y educación a sus hijos. No obstante las ventas últimamente han bajado y para poder vender todas las chipas producidas en el día debe caminar mucho hasta vaciar su canasto, ya que si no las vende todas, recuperar esa pérdida resulta difícil.&#13;&#10;Ella cuenta que para obtener un préstamo recorrió varias entidades financieras, pues nadie aceptaba las pocas referencias que ella tenía,  pero la única que la apoyo fue la Fundación Paraguaya,  gracias a eso pudo construir un horno, porque anteriormente alquilaba el horno que tenía su vecino para poder cocinar sus chipas.&#13;&#10;Hoy solicita el crédito para poder comprar materias prima como huevos, leche, almidón y queso.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>58063</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

He&apos;s married with 4 children. He has a small shop in his home where he makes &quot;chipas.&quot;  Chipa is a traditional type of food in Paraguay.  It&apos;s similar to bread and it&apos;s made with starch, cheese, milk, vegetable oil, etc.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;He makes chipas early in the morning, so that he can then go out and sale them all around the barrios (neighborhoods) in the city.  Rafael makes sure that he is present whenever there is a school event or political campaign so that he can sell his delicious chipas which are a main delight to the people from Paraguay.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Rafael tells us that this is hard work since he has to work a lot of hours in the day until he sells all of his chipas, and to start all over again the next day.  But it doesn&apos;t matter because his main goal is to provide for his family and to make sure all their basic necessities are taken care of.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In order to increase production, he would like to build another brick oven, which in the language of Guarani is called &quot;Tatakua&quot;.  This special type of oven is used by many of the people who make chipa.  He is requesting a loan in the amount of $400 USD.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Carolina Zelaya-Kronlund, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Rafael tiene 35 años, está casado y tiene 4 hijos. El posee una pequeña fábrica de chipas en su domicilio. La chipa es una comida típica muy consumida en Paraguay, es parecido al pan y está hecho a base de almidón, queso, leche, aceite vegetal, entre otros.&#13;&#10;Realiza su producción diariamente a tempranas horas de la mañana, para luego salir a venderlas de forma ambulante, recorriendo los barrios de la ciudad. Cuando se realiza eventos en colegios, universidades o de campañas políticas, el siempre se hace presente y lleva en su canasto chipas calentitas que son el mayor deleite de los paraguayos.&#13;&#10;Rafael, nos comenta que este oficio es muy sacrificado que uno debe trabajar muchas horas diarias para poder vender todas sus chipas y producirlas de nuevo. No obstante dice que su logro principal es que mediante este oficio puede mantener a su familia y cubrir por lo menos las necesidades básicas de la misma.&#13;&#10;Para aumentar su producción él desea construir otro  horno de ladrillos y barro, llamado en el idioma guaraní TATAKUA que significa horno y es el más utilizado por los productores de chipa para hornear sus productos. Para esto necesita un crédito de $ 400.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>58068</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

Wheather is rain, hot or cold, she must get out there to sell her products around the city, one barrio (neighborhood) at a time.  She is hoping to add a room to her house to give her the space she needs for her merchandise.  She is requesting a loan in the amount of $200 USD to purchase more used clothes and jewelry.

Del Carmen</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mercedes&apos; name merits an explanation. Although it seems to be a long name, it really is a commonly used form to name someone in the Dominican Republic, and in general, in Hispanic cultures. Her second last name, &quot;Del Carmen&quot;, is given after the patron saint &quot;Del Carmen Virgin&quot; from the Catholic tradition of having patron &quot;Mother of God&quot; who bears different name depending on where it is that it&apos;s used as such. It isn&apos;t strange to find that this particular &quot;Virgin&quot; is popular in the island of Puerto Rico. Insofar as her last name is concerned, the &quot;D. L.&quot;  stands for the origins of her ancestors: the Province of &quot;L.&quot; in Spain. Her second last name, R., is as common as the name &quot;Smith&quot; may be in certain parts of the U.S.A.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mercedes had 9 children, but today she only has one living with her.  Her husband died some time ago, and now she must care for her recently injured son. He was procuring the food for their plates, but fell from the motorbike on which he gave rides for a living. He is now living with a cast and there’s no certainty as to when or how he will be able to riD. the bike again. Regardless, Mercedes now wants (and as well needs) to put up a cafeteria for which she has most of the utensils (such as the thermos to keep the liquids hot, such as coffee and milk), the toaster for the bread, the blender for the fruit juices, etc. She needs a “place” to do it in, and needs to buy the raw materials. Hence, she’s taking this loan. &lt;p&gt;She used to have a small grocery store earlier on, but now decided to put up the cafeteria (right where she is standing in the picture)  because in the time between when she had the grocery store and now, she feels there have been too many stores put up in the neighborhood. She reminded us that these are good businesses (300% profit margin), but “you can’t have too many of them close by…”.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>58094</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cafe</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Build

Thanks to this hard work and concessions it is one of the most frequented shops in the area.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Today they are interested in making a venture into the traveling sales of motorcycle parts in addition to selling drinks. Because the construction work her husband is involved in does not bring him much work, this expansion will enable them to have greater profits and provide a better education for her sons.

With the returns she expects to make out of the sale of these products, she plans to be able to sustain herself together with a now six-month-old child. The father abandoned her, and she must now make it on her own! She lives with her family, as she has no means of getting a house, but her family is as poor as can be, so Carmen needs to come up with at least the basics to maintain herself and the child’s food, clothing and transportation needs. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Carmen tells us that she&apos;s realized she needs to go back to school to become a professional, so that&apos;s another reason why she needs to earn &apos;as much as the business will afford&apos;. She wouldn&apos;t say the profit margin on the beauty aids selling business, but normally it&apos;s something in the neighborhood of 100%, so she will probably do well, and start her schooling days in January, as she is now planning to do!</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>58106</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cosmetics Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To buy &quot;Safire&quot;

The only difference is that Rita has 4 kids (depicted in the picture) and she needs to assist her husband (a fresh produce salesman himself) to supply their needs to make a living. &lt;p&gt;Rita would like to &quot;become a professional&quot;, meaning that she would like to have the opportunity to go to school and earn some degree, but we explained that &quot;professionalism&quot; doesn&apos;t come from degrees so much as from &quot;doing well whatever one does&quot; for a living! This seemed to enlighten her otherwise somber-looking composure, obviously stemming from the heavy load of having to care for such a large and growing family at this stage of their lives. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She figures that she will no have much time to do her selling activity, thus she chose to sell shoes and the like, which bodes well with her needs of tending to her children and those around her. All of the kids that live under the same roof now (8 at this time) will need some kind of footwear, so this is a good place to start &apos;selling&apos;, and she plans to continue doing so in the close-by neighborhood. &lt;p&gt;A 200% profit margin should allow Rita to be able to repay her loan and obtain the benefits of assisting herself in caring for the children. The market, at least in terms of number of kids, is certainly there.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>58111</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Start a business by selling shoes for men, women and children.</use><location><country_code>DO</country_code><country>Dominican Republic</country><town>Los Alcarrizos</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>18.516667 -70.016667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>66</partner_id><posted_date>2007-09-03T06:20:03Z</posted_date><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Rita Elena</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-09-17T09:44:39Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>275</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-17T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-17T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-17T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-17T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-17T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-03-17T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.85</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45.85</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>46</amount><local_amount>46</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-17T09:23:42Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-17T10:09:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>46</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>68680</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>46</amount><local_amount>46</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-17T10:26:24Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-17T10:09:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>46</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>82869</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>46</amount><local_amount>46</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-17T10:29:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-17T10:09:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>46</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>98565</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>46</amount><local_amount>46</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-17T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-17T10:09:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>46</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>117256</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>46</amount><local_amount>46</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-17T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-17T10:09:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>46</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>137234</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>45</amount><local_amount>45</local_amount><processed_date>2008-03-17T10:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-03-17T10:09:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>45</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>159991</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-09-03T09:44:39Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-03-17T10:09:40Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>17310</id><name>Daisy</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>TRANSLATED BY MATT FLANNERY&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Daisy Patricia is 20 years old, is unmarried mother of one  of 8 months of age.

When Luís got married, he continued to work on his business and also specialized in raising exotic animals such as doves, hens and peacocks. He already has a steady stream of clients and places to exhibit his animals, where he also delivers them. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The pens are in the backyard of his house and he checks and attends to the animals daily. Every weekend, Luís goes to the market and stores to offer his products. Besides this activity, Luís cooks at the community kitchens starting from 5:00 PM. These are his only sources of income. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Luís improved the structure of his pens implement a cleaning out system with a previous loan he received. He is now hopeful that he can invest in more exotic types of birds and poultry that are more profitable than the ones he raises now. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He is 37 years old, married with 3 children. His wife works at a company and supports him with the household expenses. Together they have been able to acquire their posessions—especially the house which they have changed from a house made of cane to a cement one. Theirs is a hard-working and humble family; his wishes are for his children to be able to finish school and so to have their incomes from work to help the family.

They have one son, who is currently studying in a neighborhood primary school.&lt;p&gt;Dora sells silver and gold jewelry such as rings, hoop earrings,  chains, necklaces and other kinds of jewelry. She sells door-to-door for cash and on credit. She also makes clothing for children in &quot;Ao poi &quot;, a handcrafted fabric with needlework typical of Paraguay, to order. Her clients are teachers, neighbors, business people and on occasion, clients who live in the cities of Luque, Areguá Limpio and San Lorenzo, some 20 km from Dora&apos;s home. &lt;p&gt;Dora has been selling jewelry for 3 years; she started her business with the financial help of the Fundación Paraguay. She and her husband are poor and self-made people with a strong sense of responsibility when it comes to paying their bills and loans. With their earnings from the jewelry and the auto repair businesses, they have been able to grow and educate their family. The loan will be used to buy jewelry to sell. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dora tiene 31 años, está casada con Ramón Ferreira quien es mecánico de autos.

She has three grown children, all with families of their own. She lives alone in her own house and runs a business selling fabric of various types as well as accessories for various types of clothing.&lt;p&gt;She used to run this business with her husband. When he died after forty years of being together, her grief affected her ability to run her business. But after a few years, she began to regain the strength and courage to keep fighting and in this way make her business prosper.&lt;p&gt;She has always lived in the city of Encarnación. Her two daughters live and work in the capital city of Asunción, where they are raising their families. Her 42-year-old son lives in the same city as she does and is always nearby.&lt;p&gt;She has been in this business more than 16 years. She knows the market and has an established client base in spite of the difficulties she has lived through. She is eager to advance her business and needs some capital to give the business she started with her husband a boost.&lt;p&gt;She is asking for a loan of $1000 so that she can stock fabric, feathers, sequins, and similar merchandise. &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Antonio and Sarah Padial, Kiva Volunteers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;La Señora Virginia (62 años) es viuda desde hace 7 años, tiene 3 hijos mayores, todos independientes y con sus respectivas familias. Vive sola en su casa propia y lleva adelante un negocio de venta de telas de diferentes tipos, además de accesorios para trajes diversos.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Este negocio lo llevaba adelante con su marido, pero cuando él falleció, luego de haber compartido 40 años de matrimonio con Doña Virginia, la angustia que le quedó afecto el funcionamiento del negocio. Después de unos años fue tomando nuevamente fuerzas para seguir luchando y así llevar adelante su microempresa.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Su residencia siempre ha sido en la ciudad de Encarnación, 2 de sus hijas están en la ciudad capital de Asunción trabajando y formando su familia en esa ciudad, su hijo de 42 años vive en la misma cuidad que ella y la acompaña permanentemente. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ella se dedica a este ramo hace más de 16 años, conoce el mercado y tiene una clientela formada a pesar de las dificultades personales que vivió. Tiene muchas ganas de seguir llevando adelante su negocio, y necesita un poco de capital para impulsar la empresa que empezó con su marido.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;El préstamo solicitado de $ 1000, es para la compra de mercaderías: telas, plumas, lentejuelas y otros.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>58164</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

He is an internally displaced person who fled to Bilasuvar during the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict in1993. Sabir has ten years experience in raising livestock. He sells cows to bazaar traders in Bilasuvar. Meat is in high demand all across Azerbaijan and people eat fresh meat at home and cafes. Sabir recently raised one calf and is going to sell it, but before that he needs to purchase additional animals. He also has one cow but it does not grown up enough to give milk. Sabir applied for 1200 USD to purchase one milk cow for 700 USD and two baby calves each for 250 USD.  He plans to pay the loan back in 18 months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>58227</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

He is married and has four children. Semender has six years of experience in animal breeding. Currently he has only one milk cow, which was purchased a long ago, and Semender himself raised from a small calf. Semender sells yoghurt and milk to the local people and bazaar traders every day. He is working very hard, from early morning till late night. Dairy products are in high demand and increases every day. Keeping one cow is not enough to cover large family needs and Semender would like to borrow 1200 USD to purchase one additional cow and two calves and start selling meat products,.  Meat is in very high demand all across Azerbaijan. The estimated cost for one cow is 700 USD and for a baby calf is 250 USD.  He plans to pay the loan back in 18 months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>58230</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

In his small market he sells food, beverages, cigarettes and toiletry. Ramil lives with his old parents and his market is the only source of revenue in his family.

Both my husband and I work in this business, which is my family’s source of income. Thanks to God, sales have gone well, but we want to stock up on merchandise during these cold times, and video games, since the majority of our clients are young athletes, who are asking for sports video games. We are requesting a $1200 loan, in order to buy merchandise and video games, build up our stock and increase the family income.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Tengo ya más de 15 años en el negocio de venta de ropa y accesorios deportivos. En este negocio, que es la fuente de ingresos de mi familia, trabajamos mi esposo y yo. Gracias a Dios nos ha ido muy bien en la venta, pero queremos surtir más mercancía ahora en tiempo de frío, y video juegos, ya que la mayoría de los clientes que tenemos son jóvenes deportistas que nos están solicitando videojuegos de deportes. Estamos solicitando un préstamo de $1200, para comprar mercancía y video juegos, y tener más inventario y más ingresos para la familia.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>58265</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Khanlar R. is a 27-year-old farmer with two cows who sells dairy products to traders who, in turn, sell them in a nearby bazaar. He lives in the southern Azerbaijani region of Bilasuvar, where he relocated after fleeing Nagorniy Karabakh during Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict in 1993. He is married and has two children. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Khanlar has been selling dairy products, including milk, butter and yogurt, for five years. He started his business with money his parents saved for him. He began with one calf, which is now a full-grown cow. This cow has produced enough dairy products to allow him to buy a second cow. Khanlar would like to continue to expand his business because dairy products are in high demand all across Azerbaijan -- particularly in Baku, the capital, whose traders come Bilasuvar to purchase dairy products.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;To meet his goal, Khanlar has come to us for a loan to buy one milk cow and two calves. He estimates that one cow will cost $700-800, and the calves will cost $200-250 each.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>58334</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

This is a good business to be in because mutton is in high demand all across Azerbaijan, where people enjoy eating meat daily at home and in cafes. Banovsha works hard to meet her family&apos;s needs, and believes this is a good time to expand her business to include raising cows and producing dairy products. Buying two cows will cost $1,600; she has saved $400, and has come to us for a loan of $1,200 to cover the balance of the

can, taking into account that both study. Ana has had her shoes sales stand located at a popular market in Asunción for 12 years. She relates that, with the shoes sales, she managed to build her own house, she is very proud and thinks it’s possible to make progress and make a living for the family with hard work and sacrifice, giving them an integral education. She also has a small shop at home, ran by her husband, that provides sewing services and alteration of small garments. Her sales stand is precarious, with just a wooden table and a plastic tent for shade. Her dream is to be able to expand her sewing shop, manufacture clothes carrying her own brand and sell them at her own store. She is requesting an $800 loan, in order to buy more merchandise, such as sports shoes, dressing shoes, sandals and kids shoes. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;La señora Ana tiene 52 años, está casada con Félix Medina hace más de 25 años y tiene 2 hijas, que la ayudan en su negocio cuando pueden, teniendo en cuenta que estudian. Ana tiene su puesto de ventas de calzado en un mercado muy populoso de Asunción, desde hace 12 años. Ana nos cuenta que con la venta de calzado pudo construir su casa propia, se siente muy orgullosa y dice que se puede salir adelante y sostener a la familia con mucho trabajo y esfuerzo, dándoles una formación integral. Cuenta además con un pequeño taller de costura en su domicilio, del cual se encarga su marido, y donde realiza servicios de costura y arreglos de prendas pequeñas. Su puesto de ventas es muy precario, actualmente utiliza una mesa de madera y como sombra una carpa de plástico. Su sueño es poder ampliar su taller de costura más adelante y así fabricar ropas con su propia marca y venderla en su propio local. Ella solicita un crédito de $800 para comprar más mercaderías, como calzados deportivos, zapatos de vestir, chancletas y calzados para niños.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>58382</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe

She became a widow six years ago, remaining the family’s only support. She has five children, three of which are adults, have married and live independently. Two of her daughters live with her, go to school and help her with the knitting. The Ñandutí embroidery is used as designs or appliqué in dresses, blouses, typical garments, table cloths, purses, shoes, flags and paintings. She learned the skills when she was little, as an employee of a shop devoted to this craft. Nowadays, with great sacrifice, she managed to buy her own machine, allowing her to manufacture her embroidery and alter clothes at home; she also teaches this typical Paraguayan craft to another woman. Castorina wishes to use the loan to buy materials, such as fabrics, colored threads, needles, etc., in this way increasing production and sales. She belongs to the committee “Kuña Katypyry”, which translates to “Intelligent Woman” and is part of the Program of Entrepreneur Women, a solidary work group of 16 women.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Castorina tiene 52 años, es tejedora de Ñandutí, un bordado típico del Paraguay que es una imitación de la telaraña. Ella enviudó hace 6 años, quedando como único sostén de la familia. Tiene 5 hijos, tres ya son mayores, están casados y son independientes. Con ella viven dos de sus hijas, que van al colegio y la ayudan con el bordado. Los tejidos de Ñandutí son utilizados como apliques o como diseños en vestidos, blusas, trajes típicos, manteles, carteras, zapatos, banderas y cuadros. Aprendió el oficio desde pequeña trabajando como empleada en talleres dedicados a este rubro. Hoy día con mucho esfuerzo logró comprar su propia máquina, de manera a realizar sus trabajos y arreglos de ropas en su propia casa; además enseña a otra mujer este trabajo artesanal típico del Paraguay. Castorina desea utilizar el crédito para comprar materiales, tales como telas, hilos de colores, agujas, etc. y de ese modo aumentar su producción y ventas.

He is a humble salesman who stays with his work of sale of clocks, sun and Vista eyeglasses.  He has been positioned  for  the last 12 years on Palm street (one of the commercial streets in the center of the capital which she is the most travelled of the city).  He previously obtained a loan from  Paraguayan Foundation so he could buy more merchandises to have more variety and this way it could improve its income and improve the standard of life of its family. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Jose tells that in its beginnings, he used to ask for loans from people who received very high interest rates that he had to pay daily , removing his profit and thus he could not progress.   Nowadays he is very happy with the loans from a micro finance institution, and wishes to ask for $200 to buy more merchandises for the sale such as sun eyeglasses, clocks, radios, etc.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ORIGINAL SPANISH&#13;&#10;El señor José G. tiene 47 años su esposa lo abandono y el quedó con sus dos hijos hace 2 años. El es un humilde vendedor que se  mantiene con su trabajo de venta de relojes, anteojos de vista y de sol. Tiene su puesto hace 12 años sobre la calle Palma (una de las calles comerciales en el centro de la capital que es la más concurrida de la ciudad), gracias al préstamo obtenido con anterioridad de la Fundación Paraguaya el pudo comprar más mercaderías para tener más variedad y de esta manera pudo mejorar sus ingresos y mejorar el nivel de vida de su familia.&#13;&#10;José cuenta que en sus inicios, solicito préstamos de personas particulares que cobraban intereses muy elevados y además tenía  que pagar en forma diaria, imposibilitando la capitalización que le quitaban todas sus ganancias y así no podía progresar. Hoy día está muy contento con los préstamos a microempresarios, y desea solicitar $ 200 para comprar más mercaderías para la venta tales como anteojos de sol, relojes, radios portátiles, cintos, etc.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>58388</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>para

They live in a small house of their own, which they managed to build with great sacrifice. Fifteen years ago, she started working as a sales person; with great will and a minimal capital, she started selling brushes, handkerchiefs and bijouterie. This was only enough to eat but nonetheless, with her savings, she was able to study and learn the skills of manicure and pedicure, that presently generate income for her as well. Today, she has a stand where she sells all kinds of fruits, like oranges, apples, grapefruit, etc. She wants the $500 loan to expand her business and build a small kiosk, as her clientele has grown and she has many requests. She wishes to give a better future to her children and that they finish school and have access to a good formal job. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La Sra. Lourdes C. tiene 30 años, vive con su pareja Ever Moreira, quien es vendedor ambulante, y tiene dos pequeñas hijas de 5 y 8 años. Viven en una casita propia que con mucho esfuerzo lograron construir. Hace 15 años empezó a trabajar como vendedora; con muchas ganas y con un capital mínimo, comenzó a vender diferentes productos, como cepillos, pañuelos y accesorios de bijouterie. Esto le dejaba ingresos con los que solamente daba para comer, pero a pesar de ello con sus ganancias ahorradas, pudo estudiar el oficio de manicura y pedicura que hoy día también le genera ingresos. Actualmente tiene una casilla donde vende todo tipo de frutas como naranjas, manzanas, pomelos, etc. Desea el crédito de $500 para ampliar su negocio, construyendo un pequeño kiosco, debido a que su clientela ha crecido y tiene bastantes pedidos. Ella desea poder dar a sus hijas un futuro mejor, que culminen sus estudios y puedan acceder a un buen empleo formal.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>58389</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

He has seven years of experience in animal breeding. At first, he borrowed from his friends and purchased one calf.  When it grew up to a milk cow, it brought him good income and he purchased another one. &lt;p&gt;Currently Adelet has four cows and two buffaloes. These animals bring him good income from selling dairy products such as milk, butter and yoghurt to the local and capital bazaar traders. Adelet and his wife do not work and keeping animals is the only source of revenue in their family. This income is just enough to cover family needs. But he still has no place to keep the cattle. Adelet decided to build himself a shed and for this purpose he saved some money and applied for 1200 USD to purchase building materials.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>58440</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Going

She has five children. Sona has twelve years of experience in selling milk products. Dairy products are in high demand all across Azerbaijan and people use yoghurt and milk every day. They think it is very healthy and tasty at the same time. &lt;p&gt;Sona and her husband work very hard to cover all their family needs. But now the children are growing up and life has become much more difficult. Sona decided to improve her living conditions and purchase one milk cow and one calf for meat production. The estimated cost for a cow is 700-800 USD and for a calf is 200-300 USD.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>58461</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Dairy</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Purchase

Her older son is in grade 7 and her younger son is only two years old. &lt;p&gt;Mrs. M. and her husband, Mr. Krishna M., both make traditional idols. They have almost six years of experience in this field. In Nepal, idol making is very popular work and the demand for idols is increasing. So they need money to buy raw materials like brass, silver, wax and gold to make more idols to fulfill the demand. She seeks a $150 loan to buy such

Saatli region. Shahmurad sells dairy products to the local and capital traders and has been doing it since 1996, when he purchased his first milk cow with saved money. Shahmurad and his wife make yoghurt at their home and sell it to the local people. It brings them good income and that is enough to cover family needs. &lt;p&gt;Currently Shahmurad has two cows, but conditions to keep the cattle are very bad. Shahmurad has applied for 1000 USD to put a new roof on the cattle shed.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>58466</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Create

Her family income is very low, and it&apos;s hard to fulfill their needs. They cannot provide a better education for their children. So Mrs. S. opened her own grocery shop. Now she seeks $150 to buy grocery goods for the improvement of her shop.

She learned to weave from her neighbor when she was 20 years old. She started her silk production in 1985. Besides producing silk Sam-oeurn also sells grocery items from her home. She and her husband finished primary school in the local schools. After they come home from school, her daughters help to weave silk as well. &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Sam-oeurn has already taken out and repaid four loans from MAXIMA. She is now asking for a loan of US$ 400 to use to buy more grocery items, silk material and sewing thread, and to pay for selecting and preparing thread on the loom. We feel certain that Sam-oeurn will be able to repay the principal and interest for this loan on time, given her excellent track record as a client of MAXIMA.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>58487</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Weaving</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Purchasing

Her father died under the Khmer Rouge regime and her mother passed away in 1999 because of a serious illness. Phos and her sister learnt to weave silk from their neighbor 7 years ago. Her younger sister assists her by looking after cows in the village. Her brother is a construction worker and is currently working with her uncle in Phnom Penh. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Phos has already borrowed and repaid one loan from MAXIMA. The current loan amount she is requesting is US$ 500. She plans to use this loan to buy silk materials and sewing thread. In addition, she is going to set up a loom for her sister. Since Phos repaid her first loan in a timely fashion, we feel sure she will have no problem repaying this second loan.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>58488</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Weaving</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Purchasing

The cow brings him income from selling milk and yoghurt and meat production from calves. The beef and dairy products are in high demand all across Azerbaijan. Keeping these animals is not enough to cover his family&apos;s need and buying calves, feeding them, then waiting for them to grow takes time. Yengibar decided to enlarge his business and purchase a sheep herd. Mutton is in very high demand also and will bring him noticeable income and help him to increase his finances.

She is from the occupied Lachin region of Azerbaijan. She is homeless and staying in a worker&apos;s hostel in Sumqayit. &#13;&#10;Her family’s living condition is not good enough as the family income is rather limited. She began her business eight years ago. She started selling a small variety of flowers near the hostel where she lives. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;         With this small business and only $300 in working capital, she could hardly earn enough money to meet her family&apos;s food and important consumption needs. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;             In 2005, Seadet borrowed $400 from Normicro and expanded her business considerably. She rented a flower shop. For her second loan, she borrowed $500 and built a flower store in the market in the city of Sumgayit. Besides roses, she also sells carnations, daisies, jasmines and other sorts of flowers.&#13;&#10;           She currently wants to borrow a $900 loan to start selling fruit near her flower store and to buy digital scales for her son.  She is sure that her good business skills will be very helpful to her in repaying the loan.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>58522</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>to

Saatli region. Amiraslan is an internally displaced person who fled to Saatli from Nagorniy Karabakh during the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict in 1993. He has kept a sheep herd since 2001. From the money he saved, he purchased his first five sheep. He sells mutton to the local and capital bazaar traders. Amiraslan does not have a bachelor degree and his family was too poor too allow him finish high school. Amiraslan started to help his father when he was fifteen. Currently, selling mutton is the only source of revenue in their family. The mutton is in high demand all across Azerbaijan and people eat meat at home and in the cafes. He applied for $1000 USD to purchase 15-16 sheep for estimated cost of $60-70 USD each.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>58650</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Livestock</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Mokhbali lives with his wife and three children. Mokhbala has nine years of experience in animal breeding and he has one milk cow and sells milk and yoghurt to the local and capital traders. There is a big competition in dairy products selling and he is working very hard to cover his family needs. Mokhbala is going to purchase an additional cow and a calf.  He purchased his current milk cow two years ago when he borrowed $800 USD from Aqroinvest CU. He successfully paid back his loan and now he is applying for $1000 USD for a second loan. The estimated cost for the cow is $700-800 USD and $200-300 USD for the calf.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>58673</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

She has been a member of Pro Mujer in the city of El Alto for several years.  She started out with a small loan of about $100, which allowed her to buy small quantities of goods to stock her small grocery stand. Over the years she was able to secure larger loans, which have allowed her to get to the point today where she is able to open a well-stocked grocery store in a commercial space.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today Gladys lives with her brand new husband in a small apartment in the Cosmos 79 area.   Her plan is to find a store to rent in a commercial area of El Alto that will guarantee a higher income for the couple.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Rosario McFaull, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Gladys  M. de Torrez , tiene 26 años y esta casada hace 6 meses, pertenece a la asociación Rocío de la Mañana de Pro Mujer del Centro Focal de Villa Adela en la ciudad de El Alto.  En sus inicios como socia, Gladys consiguió un pequeño crédito de aproximadamente 100 $us, con lo que inicio su negocio, comprando víveres por unidades y tratando de abastecer su tienda. Con el paso de los años y continuando en los ciclos de la organización, ella logra acceder a créditos algo más grandes con lo que por fin consolida la apertura de un almacén bien surtido.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Actualmente Gladys vive  junto a su flamante esposo, en un pequeño departamento en la Zona de Cosmos 79, y su intención es conseguir una tienda en Anticrético  por la ceja de El Alto, zona netamente comercial y que garantiza un mayor ingreso para ella y su pareja.&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>58936</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

El sueldo del esposo no es suficiente, por tratarse de un policía y servidor público.

Condori is a divorced mother of three who belongs to the February 2nd Association of Villa Adela where she serves as Treasurer.  The association has been around for 10 years and is one of the precursors.&lt;p&gt;  Her main activity is the sale of fast food, such as hamburgers and salchipapas (a combination of hotdogs and french-fries) among other items. She sells these items at her kiosk which she obtained thanks to credit from ProMujer.

Instead of opening her shop in front of her own house, Maeva rents one of the stores at Fugalei Market which is more profitable because it offers more customers than in the village. She opens six days of the week from six in the morning to five o’clock in the evening. Maeva’s husband is in New Zealand and he sends about five hundred fortnightly to Maeva for the shop.

Seven children among the 21 her husband has in total are hers. Each wife takes care of the daily needs and education of her own children. The husband, feeling crushed by the burden of his huge family&apos;s needs, has been driven to escape his responsibilities for them.  &lt;P&gt; Hanu&apos;s primary financial source of revenue is agriculture, more precisely growing sugar cane--a very difficult job because of the manual labor involved in its cultivation. &lt;P&gt; In view of the importance of this source of income for Hanu, she would like to enlarge her fields and increase her production. To that end, she is asking for a loan of US$ 800 in order to hire some help and procure agricultural inputs (fertilizer, etc.) This will allow her to increase her revenue and thus improve living conditions for her family.&lt;P&gt; &lt;B&gt; Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer &lt;P&gt; &lt;/B&gt;Agée de 43 ans, Madame A. Hanu est la 4ème femme de son mari. Elle a sept (7) enfants sur les 21 de son mari. Chaque femme s’occupe des besoins quotidiens de ses enfants et de leur éducation. L’homme écrasé par le poids des charges de sa famille est obligé de fuir ses responsabilités.&lt;P&gt; Madame A. Hanu a comme principale source de revenu l’agriculture et particulièrement la culture de la canne à sucre. Un travail très difficile à cause de son caractère manuel. &lt;P&gt;Vu l’importance du revenu que cette activité lui procure, elle désire agrandir le champ et améliorer son rendement. Pour cela, elle sollicite un crédit de $800 afin de s’attacher le service des métayers et des intrants agricoles. Ceci augmentera ses revenus en vue d’une bonne amélioration de conditions de vie de sa famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>59085</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>increasing

type="list"><language>fr</language></languages><texts><fr>One of the main sources of revenue for Mrs. Yawa A. has been the sale of “gari” (manioc flour). At 45 years of age, Yawa is married and mother of five children. She is also responsible for caring for the six children of her co-spouse (another of her husband’s wives) who is deceased. &lt;P&gt;In view of this unusually difficult situation, none of the children has really been enrolled in school. The girls have been married off young and the boys are in apprenticeships. Even managing to supply daily meals is difficult for Yawa, who has at present no way to purchase manioc to transform into gari, and thus no income. &lt;P&gt;In order to try to remedy this dire situation, Yawa is asking for a loan of US$ 800 which will allow her to plant a field of manioc. Part of this field’s yield will be sold and the other part turned into gari, a staple of the Togolese diet. Yawa has the advantage of having a good deal of experience in her chosen work, which should prove a trump card in assuring the success of her endeavor.&lt;P&gt; &lt;B&gt; Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer &lt;P&gt; &lt;/b&gt;L’une des principales sources de revenu de Madame A. Yawa est la vente du gari,  (farine à base du manioc). Agée de 45 ans elle mariée et mère de cinq (5) enfants. Outre ses propres enfants, elle prend en charge les six (6) enfants de sa coépouse décédée. &lt;P&gt;Face à cette situation, aucun des enfants n’a réellement été scolarisé. Les filles précocement mariées et les garçons sont en apprentissage. Le repas quotidien est assuré difficilement. Elle n’a plus de moyen pour s’acheter du manioc en vue de la fabrication et la vente de gari. &lt;P&gt;Face à cette situation, Madame A. Yawa sollicite un crédit de $800 pour faire un champ de manioc. Une partie de ce champ sera destiné à la vente et l’autre partie à la fabrication du gari. L’expérience dont dispose Madame A. est un atout pour le succès de cette activité.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>59088</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>plant

A  retiree 10 years ago but she did not just stay home and collect pension from the government. All her five children are grown up and they would like very much help their parents financially but Mrs Chiên does not want to depend on her children. This is why she had contracted a loan from &quot;Quỹ Tình thương&quot; organization 10 years ago.  With an small initial loan of only 50 USD, she invested in a small store selling basic goods. Her inventory includes cooking oil, sugar, instant noodle cups ...etc. This not only generates income for her but also provides her a sense of personal satisfaction knowing that she can take care of her self. With the full support from her husband, also a retiree, Mrs Chiên requests a loan of 200 USD to buy more stock for her store which will in term increase her revenue.   &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sau khi về hưu, chị Lưu Thị Chiên, xã Hưng Đạo, huyện Hưng Nguyên không chấp nhận việc chỉ ngồi nhận những đồng lương hưu của nhà nước. Mặc dù các con chị, gồm 4 gái và một trai đều đã trưởng thành và luôn mong muốn được giúp đỡ cha mẹ nhưng chị không muốn phụ thuộc vào con cái. Đó là lý do vì sao chị tham gia Quỹ Tình thương từ 10 năm trước. Với số vốn được vay ban đầu là 50 USD, chị đầu tư vào cửa hàng tạp hóa. Cửa hàng nhỏ bao gồm những món hàng như cân đường, chai dầu ăn, gói mì chính vừa tạo ra một khoản thu nhập vừa làm chị cảm thấy vui khi thấy mình vẫn còn đủ sức làm việc. Với sự hỗ trợ, động viên của chồng cũng là một cán bộ nghỉ hưu, chị đang xin vay thêm 200 USD để mua thêm hàng, tăng thu nhập cho gia đình.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>59089</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

Four of her older children (2 boys and 2 girls) are working away from home and rarely visit, leaving her to take care of the family and all the housework on her own.  Mrs. T. starts loaning money in 1998 with the starting amount of $50 to invest in her butchery business.  After her four children grew up and left home, without any one to help out, she had to change to fish-farming and raising pigs.  Her husband, Mr. Tran Minh Quy, is a disable war veteran but has helped her a lot in both of these businesses.  On average, for every farrow of pig she sells (usually once in every 3 months) she earns a profit of $150.  Currently, Mrs T. is asking for a loan of $825 to invest in her home projects.  This amount of money will be used to buy breeding fish (for $312), breeding pig (for $200) and foodstuff for them (for $312).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Anh Hoai Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chị Nguyễn Thị Tuyết, 55 tuổi sống cùng với chồng và cô con gái nuôi tại xã Hưng Đạo, huyện Hưng Nguyên, Nghệ An. 4 người con lớn gồm 2 trai, 2 gái đều đi làm ăn xa ít có dịp về thăm cha mẹ, chị Tuyết một mình chăm lo hầu hết công việc trong gia đình. Chị bắt đầu tham gia vay vốn từ năm 1998 với mức vốn 50 USD đầu tư cho việc mua thịt lợn bán, nhưng sau khi các con đi làm xa không có người phụ giúp, chị Tuyết chuyển sang chăn nuôi cá và lợn giống. Chồng chị, anh Trần Minh Quý, một thương bệnh binh là người phụ giúp chị rất tích cực trong công việc trông nom ao cá và đàn lợn. Tính bình quân cứ sau khi bán một lứa lợn ( 3 tháng ) chị Tuyết thu lãi khoảng 150 USD. Hiện nay chị Tuyết đang làm dự án xin vay 825 USD để đầu tư cho dự án của mình. Số tiền này được chị tính toán chi tiêu như sau: 312 USD mua cá giống, 200 USD mua lợn giống, 312 USD dùng để mua thức ăn.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>825</funded_amount><paid_amount>825</paid_amount><image><id>59090</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>buy

In order to raise her three kids, Mrs. M. works really hard on her 1.4-acre field of rice and peanut and breeds pigs and poultry.  During the first year joining the Fund, she borrowed $200 to buy pigs and poultry.  From this, she earned an average of $20-30 per month.  Encouraged by the initial success, she continued to borrow money to develop her business.  Unfortunately, her youngest son got in an accident.  All the savings from M.’s project as well as the family income is used for the hospital and medicine bills.  Although facing a lot of difficulties, Mrs. M. still believes in a bright future.  Now her youngest son has just been able to walk again.  M. hopes that in 10 years, by the time she is 60, all of her children would be well-educated and each would have a good job.  Mr.s M. wants to borrow $500 to buy more pigs to expand her project, bringing more income to her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chị Nguyễn Thị Mười sống cùng ba con tại huyện Nghi Lộc, tỉnh Nghệ An.

Để nuôi 3 con ăn học, ngoài 1, 4 mẫu đất trồng lúa và lạc, chị Mười còn tích cực đầu tư chăn nuôi gà, lợn. Năm đầu tiên vào Quỹ, chị vay 200 USD để mua lợn, gà, vịt. Sau năm đầu khoản đầu tư này mang lại cho gia đình trung bình mỗi tháng 20 - 30 USD. Được khích lệ bởi thành công bước đầu chị tiếp tục vay vốn để phát triển dự án. Nhưng không may, con trai thứ 3 của gia đình chị bị tai nạn. Toàn bộ số tiền lãi từ dự án cũng như lương của hai bố con anh đi làm thuê đều chi tiêu hết vào việc thuốc thang, viện phí. Tuy gặp khó khăn nhưng chị Mười vẫn luôn tin tưởng vào tương lai. Hiện tại con trai chị đã có thể đi lại được. Chị Mười mong 10 năm nữa khi 60 tuổi các con chị đều học hành tử tế có công ăn việc làm. Cộng với số gà vịt hiện tại, chị đang làm đơn vay vốn 500 USD để mua thêm vài con lợn cho dự án tăng thu nhập của mình.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>59093</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>buy

This is her main business undertaking and she works hard at it in spite of her meager resources. &lt;P&gt;A. would like to expand her micro-business, but she does not have the necessary capital to do so. For that reason, she is requesting a loan of US$ 600 which will allow her to build a shed and to purchase raw materials for her production of basic staples for resale.&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;Madame A. Akossiwa est née le 31 décembre 1969 à Gapé. Elle est mariée et mère de dix (10) enfants. Son mari malafoutier et conducteur de taxi moto arrive difficilement à supporter sa famille. Issue d’une famille pauvre, Madame A. Akossiwa s’est adonnée très tôt à la préparation et à la vente du haricot et gari. Cette activité est la toute première qu’elle exerce avec bravoure malgré son infirmité. &lt;P&gt;Elle cherche aujourd’hui à renforcer cette activité mais ne dispose pas assez de moyens. Elle sollicite à cet effet un crédit de $600 qui va lui servir de construction d’un hangar, à l’approvisionnement des matières premières pour la préparation et la vente du haricots.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>59099</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

Married to a farmer who has difficulty supporting the family, she manages daily to come up with her share of financial input for their family’s needs. &lt;P&gt;Adjo is illiterate since she lacked the financial means to attend school. Instead, she became an apprentice. At the end of her apprenticeship and in view of her rather difficult situation, she has been obliged to rent a sewing machine to use in order to practice her trade. &lt;P&gt;With all this in mind, Adjo is asking for a loan of US$ 1000 which she plans to use to buy a sewing machine and set up a workshop where she can do her work in proper fashion. This will allow her to improve her socio-economic condition and live life more fully.&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt; Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Née en 1971 à Gapé, Madame B. Adjo est couturière. Mariée à un cultivateur qui arrive difficilement à supporter la famille,  elle se débrouille quotidiennement pour supporter les charges du ménage. &lt;P&gt;C’est une femme analphabète parce qu’elle n’a pas eu les moyens d’aller à l’école. A la fin de son apprentissage, compte tenu de sa situation difficile, elle se voit obliger de louer une machine à coudre afin d’exercer son métier.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Vu les difficultés qu’elle endure, elle sollicite un crédit de $1000 afin de se doter des machines à coudre et aménager son atelier de couture pour exercer pleinement ses activités. La réalisation de ce projet lui permettrait d’améliorer ses conditions de vie socio économiques.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>59106</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Tailoring</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>buying

His impoverished family had problems coming up with school fees for him, leading him to go to work at an early age farming. This is the main business activity in his region and Kokou works hard at it, though he has difficulty due to seasonal weather problems. He would like to purchase fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides in order to kill the weeds that cut into his harvest. For this purpose, he is requesting a loan of US$ 1000 to buy these products and increase the land he has in cultivation as well as his production. Dynamic and honest, Kokou has already received one loan which he reimbursed without difficulty.&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Monsieur A. Kokou est né à Gapé en 1970. Les difficultés de l’école dues à la pauvreté des parents l’ont poussées rapidement à s’adonner à l’agriculture. Activité première de la région, il l’exerce avec bravoure. Seulement il se voit confronter aux intempéries saisonnières. Ainsi, il pense s’acheter des engrais, des insecticides et herbicides pour tuer les mauvaises herbes qui rendent insuffisante la récolte. Pour y arriver, il sollicite un crédit de $1000 pour se doter des intrants agricoles afin d’augmenter sa surface cultivable et son rendement. Dynamique et honnête, il a déjà  bénéficié d’un crédit qu’il a remboursé sans incident.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>59112</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>buying

type="list"><language>fr</language></languages><texts><fr>At 28 years of age, Mrs. Essi D. is her husband’s third wife and mother of three children. Generally, husbands who have several wives tend to neglect their role as fathers because they are weighted down by too much responsibility for supporting their households. It is thus the women who eke out a living for their children, feeding, clothing, and educating them. Such is the situation that Mrs. D. finds herself in. &lt;P&gt;Fortunately for her children, Essi is a dynamic woman with lots of business activities. Currently, she has opened up a little telephone stand, together with selling shoes and various other products. In order to expand these micro-businesses, Essi is asking for a loan of US$ 1000 which will serve her as business capital. This will allow her to increase her profit and improve living conditions for her family.&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Agée de 28 ans, Madame D. Essi est la 3ème femme de son mari. Généralement, les  hommes qui ont plusieurs femmes négligent leur rôle de père de famille car ils sont écrasés par les charges du ménage. Il revient alors aux femmes de se battre pour nourrir, habiller et scolariser leurs enfants.  Telle est la situation dans laquelle se retrouve Madame D. Essi qui est aujourd’hui mère de trois (3) enfants. &lt;P&gt;Heureusement, elle est une femme très active et mène beaucoup d’activités. Actuellement, elle a ouvert une cabine téléphonique et y ajoute la vente des chaussures et autres produits divers. Pour améliorer cette activité, elle sollicite un crédit de $1000  qui lui servira de fonds de commerce. Ceci lui permettra d’améliorer ses revenus et d’améliorer le niveau de vie de sa famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>59121</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe

Mariée et mère de quatre (4) enfants, elle a plusieurs activités à savoir : la vente du gari et des céréales et autres produits vivriers.Ce petit commerce lui permet de contribuer pour beaucoup aux charges du ménage. Aujourd’hui, ces charges sont devenues très lourdes car le mari déjà fatigué par l’âge est devenu inactif. En vue d’augmenter la taille de ses activités, Madame A. Yawa sollicite un apport financier de $900 qui lui servira de fonds de commerce pour l’achat et la vente de ses produits. Ceci lui permettra d’accroître ses revenus et améliorer les conditions de vie de sa famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>59122</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

At 45 years of age, she is still very dynamic. Her principal activity is the sale of cereals and gari (cassava flour), a business which she combines with agriculture. The cereal business is very profitable, but requires considerable means, which Mrs. Yawa A. does not have at her disposal. She is thus asking for a loan of $850 which will serve as capital to increase her storage capacity. This will increase her income and also improve her family&apos;s living conditions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Veuve depuis bientôt 5 ans, Madame A. Yawa vit avec ses six (6) enfants. A 45 ans, elle est encore très dynamique. Son activité principale est la vente des céréales et du gari (farine de manioc), activité qu’elle associe à l’agriculture. Le commerce des céréales est une activité très rentable mais qui nécessite beaucoup de moyens.  Ce dont Madame A. Yawa ne dispose pas. Elle sollicite alors un crédit de $850 qui lui servira de fonds de commerce pour augmenter sa capacité de stockage. Ceci améliorera son revenu et du coup les conditions de vie  de sa

His principal work is the buying and selling of small ruminants. This business requires lots of travel because he needs to go to remote areas where these animals cost less. This necessitates considerable financial means. The business is very profitable, but his lack of capital makes his income insignificant, and living conditions remain difficult in his household. To strengthen his business, he is asking for a loan of $1000 which will serve to buy, transport, and re-sell small ruminants. This will allow him to meet effectively the needs of his household.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Agé de 45 ans Monsieur A. Jean est marié et père de cinq (5) enfants et a à sa charge huit (8) autres personnes. Il a comme activité principale l’achat et la revente de petits ruminants. Cette activité demande beaucoup de déplacement car il faut aller dans les localités reculées où ces petits ruminants coûtent moins chers. Cela nécessite assez de moyens financiers. L’activité est très rentable mais l’insuffisance de son capital rend le revenu insignifiant et les conditions de vie demeurent difficiles dans le ménage. Pour renforcer son commerce, il sollicite un appui financier de $1000 qui servira à l’achat, au transport et à la revente des petits ruminants. Cela lui permettra de faire face efficacement aux besoins de son foyer.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>59130</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Animal

In addition to her own children, she is responsible for four others. Her husband, who has no steady employment, has five wives and about 20 children. He is totally irresponsible and shows almost no concern for the welfare of his children. As a consequence, Mrs. A. lives in extreme poverty and many of her children do not attend school. In order to survive, she generates income from growing cassava. The tuberous roots of cassava are turned into tapioca that she sells at the market. The quality of her product has given her today a large clientele, but she can no longer meet their demand because she does not have enough cassava. To address this situation, she would like to buy some cassava fields to use in her production. She is therefore requesting a business loan of $700 to buy cassava and produce and sell tapioca. This will bring change to her day-to-day life.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Agée de 47 ans, Madame A. Akou est mariée et mère de huit (8) enfants.  En dehors de ses propres enfants, elle a à sa charge quatre (4) autres. Son mari qui n’a aucun emploi fixe a cinq femmes avec une vingtaine d’enfants. Il est totalement irresponsable et ne se soucie guère du bien-être des enfants. La conséquence est que Madame A. Akou  vit dans une extrême pauvreté et nombre de ses enfants ne vont pas à l’école. Pour survivre, elle a comme activité génératrice de revenu la culture du champ de manioc. Les tubercules de manioc sont transformés en faine (gari) qu’elle vend sur le marché. La qualité de son produit fait qu’elle a à ce jour une clientèle abondante qu’elle n’arrive plus à satisfaire car elle n’a pas suffisamment de manioc. Pour améliorer cette situation, elle désire désormais acheter des champs de manioc pour sa production. Elle sollicite à cet effet un crédit de $700 qui va lui servir de fonds de commerce pour l’achat de manioc, la fabrication et la vente du gari. Cela apportera un changement dans sa vie de tous les jours.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva

Aku is a married, mother of five (5) children and has under her care three (3) other people. Her principal business activity is sale of paraffin oil in her locality. This activity gets enough incomes to her and allows her to contribute for a great part to the loads of the household. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Today, a very strong request for products of general food is felt and Mrs. A. Aku seized the occasion to also sell food in addition to oil sales. But she needs enough money to reinforce the activity. It is regularly in out-of-stock condition, and the customers are obliged to go elsewhere to make their purchases. To cure that and to satisfy her customers effectively, she requests a loan of $500 which will be used by her for the purchase and the sale of the products of general food.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;ORIGINAL FRENCH&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Agée de 50 ans, Madame A. Aku est mariée, mère de cinq (5) enfants et a à sa charge trois (3) autres personnes. Elle a comme activité principale la vente de pétrole lampant dans sa localité. Cette activité lui procure assez de revenus et lui permet de contribuer pour une grande part aux charges du ménage. Aujourd’hui, une demande très forte de produits d’alimentation générale se fait sentir et Mme A. Aku a saisi l’occasion pour associer ce petit commerce à sa vente de pétrole. Mais elle a besoin d’assez d’argent pour renforcer l’activité. Elle est régulièrement en rupture de stock, et les clients sont obligés de se rendre ailleurs pour faire leurs achats. Pour remédier à cela et satisfaire efficacement sa clientèle, elle sollicite un crédit de $500 qui lui servira de fonds de commerce pour l’achat et la vente des produits d’alimentation générale.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>59152</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Having obtained an initial loan of $300, she set up a small grocery business.

Ablavi est mère de trois (3) enfants et vit avec son mari dans des conditions difficiles. Le mari analphabète n’a aucun métier sous la main. L’avenir des enfants est presque compromis. Mais le courage de cette jeune femme donne beaucoup d’espoir au foyer. Avec un premier crédit de $300 qu’elle avait obtenu, elle a initié un petit commerce d’alimentation générale. Aujourd’hui, après avoir bien remboursé son crédit, elle sollicite de nouveau un appui d’un montant de $750 qui va lui servir de fonds de commerce.  Soutenir cette famille est aussi une œuvre humanitaire pour l’avenir des enfants.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva

Most of her children are not in school because she lacks sufficient financial means to pay school fees, etc. Illiterate parents unfortunately often do not have high expectations for their children’s education. &lt;P&gt;Farming had always been Mrs. Y.’s principal source of income but nowadays, her impoverished soil has made crop production very poor and so suddenly, she finds herself with little income and living conditions for her family become worse and worse. &lt;P&gt;Mrs. Y., aware of this situation, has opened a little business selling rice, gari (manioc flour, a Togolese staple), cooking oil, etc. This initiative has begun to improve her income to the point where she feels the need to apply for a loan of US$ 750 to expand her micro-business. The expansion of her business will allow her to send her children to school.&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer &lt;P&gt;&lt;/b&gt;A 47 ans, Madame Y. Dovi est mariée et mère de dix (10) enfants. Presque tous ses enfants ne sont pas scolarisés faute de moyens financiers. Les parents analphabètes ne nourrissent aucune ambition pour leurs progénitures. &lt;P&gt;L’agriculture est l’activité principale de cette femme mais aujourd’hui, la pauvreté des sols fait que les rendements sont devenus très mauvais. Du coup, il n’y a plus de sources de revenus et les conditions de vie sont devenues pires qu’avant. &lt;P&gt;Madame Y. Dovi, consciente de la situation, a vite monté un petit commerce de riz, gari, de l’huile et autres.

She has experienced hunger and much suffering in caring for her five children, but she has managed to earn a minimum income for her family thanks to rudimentary farming, selling gari (manioc flour, a Togolese staple), and especially selling cooked gruel. At this point, she would like to set herself up to sell other staples along with the gruel. With that goal in mind, she is asking for a loan of US$ 500 which will allow her to get some basic shelving and stock and sell basic necessities. This will allow her to improve living conditions for her family.  &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Abandonnée par son mari depuis plusieurs années, Madame G. Amé est âgée de 50 ans environ. Elle a connu la faim et la souffrance avec ses cinq (5) enfants. Elle arrive à faire survivre sa famille avec une agriculture rudimentaire, la vente du gari et surtout la vente de la bouillie qui lui procure le minimum tous les jours. Aujourd’hui, elle souhaite s’installer afin de vendre à part la bouillie les produits de première nécessité.

Her husband is without viable financial resources, so the whole burden of providing for the family rests with her. &lt;P&gt;A courageous and enterprising woman, Kofissi works hard every day to support her children. Her first two loans were reimbursed without problem. As micro-businesses, she raises farm animals and sells basic grocery products. Her great ambition is now to open a little grocery store. Since she has no capital for this micro-business, she is now asking for a loan of US$ 1000 to allow her to make her dream a reality.&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Agée de 33 ans, Madame G. Kofissi est mère de quatre (4) enfants et a à sa charge cinq (5) autres personnes. Le mari étant sans emploi rémunérateur viable, toute les charges de la famille se repose sur la femme. &lt;P&gt;Femme courageuse et entreprenante, elle se bat au quotidien pour nourrir ses enfants. Ses deux premiers crédits ont été bien remboursés sans aucun incident. Elle fait de l’élevage et le commerce des produits d’alimentation générale. Aujourd’hui son ambition est grande : ouvrir une boutique d’alimentation générale. Faute de moyens, elle sollicite un crédit de $1000 pour la réalisation de ce projet.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>59192</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

She has a great deal of difficulty providing the basic necessities for her children, especially their school fees, etc. The older ones have had to leave school due to lack of financial means. Yawa’s business activity is selling the lengths of cloth used as wraps or sarongs in Africa (pagnes) and cosmetics. Unfortunately, she has very little capital to expand her business. For that reason, she is requesting a loan of US$ 800 to increase her profit and be able to send her children to school.&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Devenue veuve depuis 3 ans, Madame A. Yawa est âgée de 39 ans et mère de six (6) enfants. Elle a toutes les difficultés pour assumer les besoins quotidiens de ses enfants et surtout leur scolarité. Les aînés ont dû abandonner l’école faute de moyen. L’activité qui lui procure un peu de revenu est la vente de tissus pagnes et des produits de beauté. Malheureusement elle a des moyens très limités pour pouvoir agrandir ce commerce. C’est pour cela qu’elle sollicite un crédit de $800 afin d’améliorer ses revenus et assurer la scolarité de ses enfants.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>59197</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

She has always proven herself by repaying her previous loans without incident.

Ce commerce demande beaucoup de fonds car les zones d’approvisionnement sont bien éloignées de la Région Maritime où elle habite. Pour rentabiliser cette activité, il faut acheter beaucoup de produits lors d’un déplacement. Ceci exigerait la disponibilité de beaucoup d’argent. C’est pour cela qu’elle sollicite $800.

work as a miller.  Today, as the owner of two mills, he is married and the father of two.  A very energetic and honest man, he figured out how to manager his first loan, which he has repaid without a problem.  He is again requesting a loan of $1200 to buy a new mill.  He believes he can increase his throughput and thus his income.  He will then be able to do more to help improve his family&apos;s living conditions.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Né le 20 décembre 1980 à Notsè, Monsieur K. Migan Gérard a cessé les études après le cours primaire et s’est lancé dans les activités de moulineur. Propriétaire de 2 moulins, il est marié et père de deux (2) enfants. Très dynamique et honnête, il a su bien gérer le premier crédit obtenu et l’a remboursé sans incident. De nouveau, il sollicite un crédit de $1200 qui servira à l’achat de moulin neuf. Par ceci, il pense augmenter son chiffre d’affaires et de facto ses revenus. Il pourra ainsi, contribuer d’avantage à l’amélioration des conditions de vie de sa famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>59227</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Services</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To

Married and the mother of two, she manages to help her husband with household expenses due to the revenue she brings in from her sales.  An energetic and serious woman, she figured out how to manager two initial loans, which have been repaid without a problem. At present, she is requesting a loan of $850 to buy wholesale frozen chicken and fish, in order to strengthen her business.  With this loan, she believes she will increase her income to better help with improving her family&apos;s living conditions.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Née vers 1971 à Tsévié, Madame K. Adakou a arrêté ses études après le cours primaire et s’est lancée dans la vente de poissons et de poulets congelés. Mariée et mère de deux (2) enfants, elle arrive à partager les charges du foyer avec son mari grâce aux revenus que lui procurent ses ventes. Dynamique et sérieuse, elle a su bien gérer ses deux premiers crédits qui ont été remboursés sans incident. A présent elle sollicite un crédit de $850 qui servira à l’achat en gros, de poulets congelés et de poissons pour renforcer son activité. Par ce crédit, elle pense augmenter ses revenus pour mieux contribuer à l’amélioration des conditions de vie de sa famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>59231</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fish

Par ce nouveau crédit qui servira à l’achat des machines à coudre et des tissus pour la confection des habits prêt-à-porter, il pense contribuer davantage à l’amélioration des conditions de vie de sa famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>59237</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Tailoring</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To

He gave up his high school studies due to lack of financial means and launched himself into agriculture.  Having become a farmer of renown by adding a poultry farm to his vegetable-growing business, he well-managed his initial loan which was repaid without difficulty.  Versatile in his business, he solicits a new loan of $950 which will enlarge the area of his cultivated land and improve his chicken farm.  With the current loan he means to benefit  more areas of his business after raising his turnover, to best contribute to improving the living conditions of his family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Erin Spencer, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Monsieur N. Edoh est âgé de 42 ans. Il a arrêté ses études au cours secondaire par manque de moyens financiers et s’est lancé dans l’agriculture. Devenu un grand exploitant agricole de renommé par son bonne association d’élevage à la culture végétale, il a su bien gérer le premier crédit qu’il a remboursé sans incident. Dynamique dans ses activités, il sollicite un nouveau crédit de $950 qui servira à l’agrandissement de sa surface cultivée et améliorer son élevage de volailles. Par le présent crédit, il pense rentabiliser plus ses activités afin d’augmenter son chiffre d’affaires pour mieux contribuer à l’amélioration des conditions de vie de sa famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>59242</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Expand

cassettes, and DVDs.  Single and without children, he takes care of one little brother and his mother.  Very skilled in the management of his business,  he repaid his two first loans without default.  Now he requests a new loan of $850 which will resupply his shop with new videos and DVDs.  Through this he intends to boost his sales to best improve his family&apos;s living conditions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Erin Spencer, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Née en 1979 à Tsévié, Monsieur A. Komlan a arrêté ses études au niveau secondaire par manque de moyen et s’est lancé dans la vente des cassettes et de disque CD Vidéo. Célibataire sans enfant, il a à sa charge un petit frère et sa mère. Très doué dans la gestion de ses affaires, il a su bien rembourser ses deux premiers crédits sans incident. A présent, il sollicite un nouveau crédit de $850 qui servira à ravitailler sa boutique en nouveaux CD et cassettes vidéo. Par ceci il pense augmenter son chiffre d’affaires pour mieux contribuer à l’amélioration des conditions de vie de sa famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>59245</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Music Discs

She resides in Tsévié where she runs her business selling root vegetables and coal.  Married, she is the mother of three children who are left in her charge because her husband has just married another woman.  She also cares for a niece who has lost her mother.  Courageous and full of confidence, she has continued her business thanks to an initial loan she obtained for $500.  This allowed her to free up much of her income for the basic needs of her children.  Despite being illiterate, she manages her affairs extraordinarily well and is always on time in the repayment of her loans.  She is a trustworthy woman who deserves support. &lt;p&gt; This loan of $850 that she requests will permit her to buy a very important stock of yams and wood coal.  Thus, her sales will be increased and she can invest in the upbringing, health, and education of her children.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Erin Spencer, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame A. Amavi est née en 1976 à Gapé (Préfecture du Zio). Actuellement elle réside à Tsévié où elle fait son commerce de vente de tubercules et de charbon. Mariée, elle est mère de trois (3) enfants qui sont laissés à sa charge car le mari vient d’épouser une autre femme. En plus, elle a en charge une nièce qui a perdu sa mère. Courageuse et pleine de confiance, elle a continué son activité grâce à un premier crédit de $500 qu’elle a obtenu. Ce qui lui a permis de dégager un revenu substantiel aux besoins élémentaires des enfants. Bien qu’analphabète, elle gère de façon extraordinaire son activité et est toujours très correct dans le remboursement de ses crédits. Elle est une femme de confiance et mérite d’être soutenue. &#13;&#10;Ce crédit de $850 qu’elle sollicite lui permettra de faire un stock plus important d’igname et de charbon de bois. Ainsi, son chiffre d’affaires pourra augmenter et elle pourra investir plus dans l’éducation, la santé et la scolarisation des enfants.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>59258</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Charcoal

nephews and a niece.  For the last 15 years she has been doing small retailing and farming. With these activities she assumes as best one can the food needs of the children.  Honest and dynamic, she has been able to manage her three previous loans. In order to increase her cultivable land, she is soliciting a financial help of $750 that will allow her to cultivate corn, manioc, okra and peanut. Part of it will be designated for the sale of peanuts, medicines and others.  Thus she will be able to provide for her family’s needs. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Véronique Fourment, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Née le 22 Mars 1966, Madame L. Afi Lucia n’a pas d’enfants mais elle a en charge trois (3) neveux et une nièce. Elle fait depuis plus de 15 ans le petit commerce et l’agriculture. A partir de ces activités, elle assume tant bien que mal les besoins alimentaires des enfants. Honnête et dynamique, elle a su gérer les trois précédents crédits obtenus. Afin d’étendre sa surface cultivable, elle sollicite un appui financier de $750 qui servira à faire la culture de maïs, de manioc, de gombo et d’arachide. Une partie va être destinée à la vente d’arachide, de médicaments et autres. Elle pourra ainsi subvenir aux besoins de la famille.&lt;p&gt;</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>59271</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Cutivate

responsible for eight (8) persons. His wife, a reseller, does not earn enough to be able to contribute to the household expenses. Mr. Komlan A. has been a carpenter for the last 34 years.  Because of the quality of his work he has the confidence and respect of his clients. He manages his activity well and is very honest reimbursing his previous loans.  In order to increase his business, he is soliciting a financial help of $950 to buy boards and logs for his work.  With this loan his sales figures will be able to increase and he will be able to invest more in the education and health of his family.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Véronique Fourment, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Né en 1953 à Bolou-Dékpo (Préfecture du Zio), Monsieur A. Komlan Kalépé est marié et a huit (8) personnes à sa charge. Son épouse, revendeuse ne gagne pas assez pour pouvoir contribuer aux charges du ménage. Monsieur A. Komlan exerce comme activité la menuiserie il y a 34 ans. A cause de la qualité de son travail, il a la confiance et l’estime des clients. Il gère de façon correcte son activité et est très honnête dans le remboursement des crédits obtenus. En vue d’accroître ses activités, il sollicite un appui financier de $950 pour acheter des planches et grumes pour son travail. Avec ce crédit, son chiffre d’affaires pourra augmenter et il pourra investir plus dans l’éducation et la santé de la famille.&lt;p&gt;</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>59275</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Carpentry</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>To

Kossi was born in 1975 in Gati in the prefecture of Zio. After his primary studies, he obtained a car  driving licence. Not having the means to buy a car, he completed 5 years of farming after that.   Married and father of two children, his wife does not have any income generating activity  -- with the result that all the needs are all supported by Mr A.. From his farming business, the family performs well -- it is responsible for the family&apos;s survival. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;He is honest and rigorous,  In order to have his own motor-driven pump, he requests a loan of $1000. He will be able to thus increase the farm&apos;s cultivable surface for an increase in its profits. This will be able to thus provide even more suitably for the needs of the family.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ORIGINAL FRENCH&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Monsieur A. Kossi est né en 1975 à Gati dans la préfecture du Zio. Après ses études primaires, il a fait la conduite auto sanctionnée par un permis de conduire. N’ayant pas les moyens pour s’acheter une voiture, il fait depuis plus de 5 ans le maraîchage. Marié et père de deux enfants, son épouse n’a aucune activité génératrice de revenu, ce qui fait que toutes les charges sont supportées par Monsieur A.. A partir de cette activité qu’il maîtrise si bien et à qui il doit sa survie, il assume tant bien que mal les besoins alimentaires des enfants. Honnête et rigoureux, il a su gérer les deux crédits obtenus. Afin d’avoir sa propre motopompe, il sollicite un crédit de $1000. Il pourra ainsi agrandir sa surface cultivable pour une augmentation de ses revenus. Il pourra ainsi subvenir convenablement aux besoins de la famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>59277</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Achat

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) from the Qubadli region. He is the only breadwinner for his family. His family’s living conditions are not good enough. The family income is rather limited. Elshad began his business 6 years ago. Because he did not have enough financial resources, he couldn’t develop his business well enough in the beginning.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With this small business and only $200 in working capital, he could hardly earn enough money to meet his family&apos;s food and important consumption needs. After awhile he made important steps in his business and increased the area of his trading.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Now, he wants to borrow $400 in order to further develop his business, to build a store and to buy digital scales. He will improve his family’s living conditions with this additional income and obtain some funds for the education of his

The children are all currently enrolled in school with the eldest (girl) in senior high, and the others in junior high, Fifth Grade and First Grade.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2002, H. bought a small taxi vehicle and operated a special hire business for 3 years. He then sold the taxi and used the proceeds to buy a small plot of land and build a house for his family. Since then, H. has been employed as a special hire taxi driver, which does not earn as much as his previous employment when he actually owned the vechicle he drove.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;H. would like to secure another car to enable him to make sufficient money to support his family. He has already registered with Wandegeya Tour and Traveling Association, an umbrella organization for the special hire taxi drivers. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;He is therefore requesting a loan of $1,200 from Kiva and $1,181 from Share An Opportunity Micro finance, making a total of $ 2381 (four million Uganda Shillings 4,000,000) payable in 8 months. This loan will help H. become a self reliant person who is also able to meet all his family&apos;s living expenses.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>60677</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Taxi</activity><sector>Transportation</sector><use>Puchase
