Mary Grace S. M. knows this truth and grabs every opportunity that comes her way. Mary Grace, 46, reached the college level of education and is married to Rolando, a government employee. Together they are raising three children, two of whom are in high school while the other one is already working. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mary Grace presently runs a direct-selling business, in which she sells items to her neighbors. Her products include fashionable bags, accessories, apparel, cosmetics and footwear, among others. Having been at least 25 years in business, she knows how to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most important, her customers. Monthly, she is able to earn an average of 10,000 Philippines pesos (Php).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching. She plans to take this opportunity to drive her business toward more profitability.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mary Grace&apos;s life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*All CCT community partners/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1150</funded_amount><paid_amount>1150</paid_amount><image><id>672572</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Her mother, Tsedevsuren, is 66 years old and retired. Ganzul operates a barber shop in a rented space. Her work place is located next to a public bath house and attracts many customers. She has been working as a hairdresser since 2005. Her business has grown steadily over the years due to her loyal customers. After many years of owing this business, she has gained not only significant experience as a hairdresser, but also a wide-ranging customer base. For the future, she hopes to continue her business with stable operation and have her own hair salon. Ganzul is requesting a 500,000 MNT loan in order to purchase necessary equipment, materials and tools from Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

Building her business, Ivy would like to receive a loan of 10,000 PHP to increase the inventory of goods sold in her sari-sari store. She is planning to purchase additional products such as rice, sugar, eggs, cooking oil and other stocks of her store. Ivy believes that offering a wide assortment of goods to customers will increase traffic to her store and maintain customer loyalty in their village. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since the course of her membership in Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), a Kiva microfinance partner in the Philippines, Ivy has been a model member, demonstrating regular attendance to weekly center meetings and steady repayments on previous loans. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her long term goals are to offer a better future for her family and sustain the profitability of her store.  Through hard work and determination, Ivy is focused on improving her quality of life with the support of ASHI and Kiva lenders.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her future goals are to purchase a new jeepney. By owning her own transportation, Ivy will save time and money going to market to buy supplies for her store. With her hard work, focus, and determination, Ivy is hopeful that her business will continue to be more productive and improve her quality of life, out of poverty.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She also dreams of owning a house and lot free from flooding, of completing the college education of her children and finding great jobs in the future.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She says “Salamat” (native dialect means Thank You) to all Kiva supporters for open hands and hearts for the poor women who want to pursue dreams in life, like her. She prays that they should be blessed.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>672571</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Roberta J. knows this truth and grabs every opportunity that comes her way. Roberta, 67, reached high school and is a widow with six children. Five are already working and one lives at home. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Roberta presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store, in which she sells items that are needed daily by neighbors in her community. Products on her shelves range from soap bars to candies and from energy drinks to rice. Having been at least 25 years in business, she knows how to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most importantly, her customers. Monthly, she is able to earn an average of PHP 9,000.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching.  Roberta plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward more profitability.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Roberta&apos;s life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*All CCT community partners/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>672587</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Marciana G. knows this truth and grabs every opportunity that comes her way. Marciana, 56, has a high school education and is married to Ceferino, a bouncer. They are raising one child who is in high school. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Marciana presently runs a direct selling business. Products range from household detergents, cosmetics, apparel and footwear, among others. Having been at least two years in business, she knows how to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most importantly, her customers. Monthly she is able to earn an average of Php5,000.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php12,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her direct selling business and other items ordered in advance by her customers all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching. She plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward more profitability.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Marciana&apos;s life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*All CCT community partners/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>672613</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>items

Sr. is from the village of Barangcuag, Angadanan, Isabela. He is 57 years old. Efren is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Efren is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Efren operates a furniture making business, producing and selling cabinets and wardrobes  to local businesses and community members. Efren has been engaged in his business for over ten years and earns approximately 12,000 PHP a month for these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2006, Efren joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Efren has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory. Efren is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional inventory. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Efren from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue to improve his business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2375</funded_amount><paid_amount>2375</paid_amount><image><id>672603</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Furniture

Development Group-Jinja</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>50-year-old Florence B. has been operating her retail shop in Magamaga, Jinja, for the last decade. She said she made the decision to start up this business in the face of dire circumstances that on many occasions rendered her helpless as to how to provide for her family. At that time she was more preoccupied with agriculture, a modest means of subsistence. Through the course of the past decade, she said hard work and determination have become her mantra. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Florence is happily married with 10 children.  She said she has been selling mostly household necessities, and her clients are mostly people from the neighborhood.   She said this business generates for her 180,000 shillings in weekly profit.

F. tiene una tienda en el municipio de Puerto Colombia. Esta es una pequeña ciudad costera en la que a principio del siglo veinte funcionó el más importante puerto marítimo del país. La microempresaria es peluquera de profesión y durante muchos años trabajó en varios salones de estética. Hace cinco años su esposo, que era vendedor en un almacén de electrodomésticos, perdió su empleo y fue ahí cuando nació la idea de crear su propio negocio. En un principio el surtido de víveres era pequeño, pero con el paso del tiempo fue mejorando, al igual que la adquisición de vitrinas, estantes y refrigeradores. Hoy en día la señora Janeth alterna su oficio de tendera con el servicio a domicilio de peluquera. Este es el tercer crédito que tramita con la Fundación Mario Santo Domingo y su primer Credikiva que planea invertirlo en la compra de víveres en general, siempre se ha distinguido por su excelente puntualidad. El negocio tiene un volumen mensual de ventas de $ 5.000.000 COP y el margen promedio de utilidad es del 20%. La señora Janeth planea para el próximo año alquilar un local más grande para trasladar la tienda y adecuar el sistema de autoservicio. Ella manifiesta que disfruta mucho su actividad de tendera porque le permite estar en permanente contacto con los vecinos de su comunidad, por lo cual, su mayor satisfacción no es la utilidad económica que le genera su microempresa, sino el aprecio que le dispensan todos sus clientes.</es><en>Janeth A. F. has a store in the town of Puerto Colombia.  This is a small coastal town which, at the beginning of the twentieth century, was home to the most important shipping port in the country.  This small businesswoman is a hairdresser by profession and, over many years, she worked in several beauty salons.  Five years ago her husband, who was a salesman in an electrical appliance store, lost his job and this was when the idea to create her own business was born.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At first, the store was not very well stocked with foodstuffs but, over time, it improved.  Janeth also acquired display cases, shelves and refrigerators.  Now she divides her time between her trade as a shopkeeper and her hairdressing services which she offers in people&apos;s homes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is Janeth&apos;s third loan with Fundación Mario Santo Domingo and her first Kiva loan.  She plans to invest the money in buying general foodstuffs.  She has always been noted for her excellent punctuality.  Her business has a monthly sales volume of 5,000,000 Colombian pesos and her average profit margin is 20%.  Janeth plans, next year, to rent larger premises so that she can transfer her store and adapt the self-service system.  She says that she enjoys her business as a shopkeeper a lot because it allows her to be in permanent contact with the neighbors in her community.  Her greatest satisfaction is not the money that her small business makes but rather the appreciation that her customers all show her.</en></texts></description><status>in_repayment</status><funded_amount>1150</funded_amount><paid_amount>830.55</paid_amount><image><id>667122</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

The company Viviana works for employs many mothers in the area but only offers part-time positions and seasonal, contract work. As a result, the salaries earned by laborers are low, hardly enough to support a family: 150,000 Colones per month (roughly $300).  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Viviana makes up for the low salary she earns by selling various products to members of her community, many of whom she works with. She plans to use this loan to make investments in merchandise such as shoes, clothing and perfumes, which she hopes to sell before Christmas. The loan consultant that has been working with Viviana describes her as a hardworking entrepreneur who has demonstrated her ability to make punctual repayments. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Viviana has been selling merchandise over the past three years; she has secured a base of regular clients and her business is expanding. Her main obstacle at the moment is a lack of access to working capital. In order to satisfy the existing demands of her clients, she must make merchandise purchases up front, so that she can make sales to her clients on credit. This loan will help to address this obstacle. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the mornings, Viviana works at the Tropifrost while her mother takes care of the children. In the afternoons, Viviana is dedicated to her business, making sales, collecting repayments or purchasing merchandise.

María dedicates the time she can, usually afternoons, to selling cooking pots and microwaveable plastic containers to acquaintances, friends and neighbors. María hopes to use this loan to make investments in such products. She has been earning a living in this way over the past four years. The only obstacle she faces is a lack of access to working capital funds, which she needs in order to make payments up front for the products she sells to her clients, often on credit. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;María has been a client of Fundación Mujer for a number of years. This, however, will be her first individual loan. In the past, María has demonstrated an exemplary ability to make punctual repayments. She is a caring daughter, mother and entrepreneur, in charge of the care of her mother and, since the beginning of this year, her father as well. Despite her non-business responsibilities, her list of clients is growing and revenues are increasing. This can be attributed to her natural tendency to work hard, and her dedication to her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;María&apos;s main goal is to establish a better way of life for her family.

His future plans are to progress and support his family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This Esperanza associate began with us because he wants to improve his business and his story is representative of his group and of Esperanza&apos;s Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. His group is located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water, none of which is potable, and electricity.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2925</funded_amount><paid_amount>2925</paid_amount><image><id>672882</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

Todos los días se levanta muy temprano para poder cocinar y ofrecer la variedad platillos a sus clientes. Pero los fines de semana se dedican por completo al cuidado de su chacra, ya que mientras más cuidadosa sea sus cultivos, obtendrá mejores granos de cacao al momento de cosecharlos. Lo que más le gusta de su trabajo es la temporada de cosecha, por que sabe que cuando estén bien maduras y secos los compradores de cacao le ofrecerán mejores precios por su producto. Lleva 18 años trabajando en el campo, sin embargo tiene que cuidar sus plantaciones de la plaga de insectos que constantemente perjudica su producción. Con el tiempo espera comprar más tierras para poder sembrar más plantíos de cacao. Este es su 22avo crédito con MFP y  esta dispuesta  a pagar todas sus cuotas a tiempo, ya que no quiere causarle problemas a su banco comunal, donde es muy querida por el resto de sus socias. Con los dos mil soles que solicita, contratará jornaleros para que le ayuden a sembrar más plantas de cacao en su parcela, para así obtener más ingresos económicos. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Alejandra, 37, is married to Fernando, 40.  They have three children and live in their own house made of insubstantial materials like lumber and metal sheeting.  Her family is very united and wants to get ahead in life together.  Alejandra’s activity is a restaurant and cocoa bean farming.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She gets up early every morning to cook a variety of dishes to have available for her customers.  But on weekends they are completely dedicated to caring for their fields because the more care she gives to her crops the better cocoa beans will be produced at harvest.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;What she likes most about her work is harvest time because she knows that when the beans are mature and dry cocoa bean merchants will offer her the best prices for her product.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has been working in the fields for 18 years and must protect her plants from insect infestations that constantly damage production.  In time she’d like to buy more land in order to plant more cocoa bean plants.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is her 22nd loan with MFP and she is willing to make her repayments on time because she doesn’t want to cause any problems for her communal bank where she is very well liked by the other members.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She will use the requested 2000 soles to hire day laborers to help her plant more cocoa bean plants in her field in order to obtain more income.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>672897</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>

She opens her grocery store at 5am and waits for neighbours to arrive to buy the goods she sells. She is a very cheerful and attentive saleswoman, who always welcomes her customers with a smile and helps them with their purchases. What she likes most about her work is being able to assist her customers. She has had the business for 5 years. She thinks the most difficult aspect is being on her feet all day. But all the effort is worth while, because it is going well and she gets a lot of benefit from this work. With time she hopes to expand the shop and to stock more merchandise, because that way she will be able to offer her customers a better variety of products.

is the hope). All the members of this group are Haitians and they are located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and three children. She says that her most difficult challenge is to give credit to her clients.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Martires is excited to be taking her first loan with Esperanza. She has had her business for 15 years, starting with a small amount of capital that she saved. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business to buy some canned products, oil cans, and other foods, She operates a Colmado, a place where you can find all the ingredients to make your daily food. Normally those colmados are in the same neighborhood, just a short walk from any home. She will use the profits to invest in her business and to save because she wants to buy a small pick up (vehicle). Her future plans are to improve her business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This Esperanza associate began with us because her business needed capital and she found this program very interesting. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza&apos;s Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2725</funded_amount><paid_amount>2725</paid_amount><image><id>672944</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

S. es una alegre mujer que vive en Cartagena en compañía de su esposo y tres hijos. Tiene un pequeño salón de belleza en el cual ofrece el servicio de peinados, corte, tintes y planchado de cabello. Este oficio lo aprendió de manera empírica hace varios años con sus hermanas menores y luego perfeccionó sus técnicas con varios cursos en academias de educación técnica en Cartagena. Al principio la microempresaria sólo atendía a su círculo de amigos y familiares cercanos, pero con el paso del tiempo, su clientela fue creciendo y empezó a comprar herramientas y accesorios profesionales. Ella también vende carne de res en horas de la mañana a vecinos y amigos del barrio a quienes les acredita el producto para que le cancelen semanal o quincenalmente. Este es el segundo crédito que tramita con la Fundación Mario Santo Domingo y su primer Credikiva que planea invertir en la remodelación del piso de la sala donde funciona el salón de belleza y comprar más carne de res. Entre los dos negocios la usuaria obtiene una utilidad mensual aproximada de $700.000. Ella sueña con instalar un gran salón de estética en un lugar diferente a su residencia, con aire acondicionado y otras comodidades que le permitan ofrecer un mejor servicio. La mayor satisfacción que le genera el negocio a la señora Nuris es generar unos importantes ingresos que ayudan al sostenimiento del hogar y especialmente poder atender la educación y los tratamientos médicos de una hija discapacitada.</es><en>Mrs. Nuris C.

But with the passage of time, her clientele grew and she started buying tools and professional accessories.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She also sells beef during the morning to friends and neighbors in the neighborhood.  She sells it to them on credit and they repay weekly or biweekly.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is the second loan she has negotiated with Fundación Mario Santo Domingo and her first Kiva loan.  She plans to use it to remodel the floor in the room where her beauty salon operates and to buy more beef.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The two businesses together produce a monthly profit of approximately $700.000.  She dreams with setting up a great beauty salon in a different part of her residence with air conditioning and other comforts that will make it possible for her to offer better service.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Most of the satisfaction that the business generates for Nuris is in generating important income that helps support the household especially for the education and medical

Carmen de Bolívar, al norte de Colombia. El, desde muy niño, ayudaba a su madre en el oficio de tendero y, ante la reciente e intempestiva muerte de ella, debió hacerse cargo del negocio. Héctor, a pesar de vivir en una localidad eminentemente agrícola y productora de artesanías, optó por dedicarse a la venta de víveres. La mayoría de sus clientes son campesinos que viven en veredas cercanas y hacen compras cada semana. Casi todas las ventas las realiza de contado y esto le permite ofrecer precios más bajos. El promedio de ventas diarias es de $ 400.000 COP y el margen promedio de utilidad es del 15%. Este es su primer préstamo con la Fundación Mario Santo Domingo y  planea invertirlo en la compra de víveres al por mayor. En un futuro próximo, el microempresario planea convertir su negocio en un autoservicio para mayor comodidad de sus clientes. El combina el trabajo con el estudio y por ser el hermano mayor, les inculca a sus hermanos la necesidad de capacitarse para ser ciudadanos de bien. Lo que más le gusta a Héctor de su trabajo es el contacto permanente con las personas que visitan su negocio, algunas de las cuales son buenos amigos. Sueña con ser un profesional y poder ayudar a los niños más pobres de su localidad en honor a la memoria de su madre, quien siempre se distinguió por ser una dama generosa.</es><en>Héctor Martínez B. is a young salesman who lives in the town of Carmen del Bolívar, in the north of Colombia.  Since he was a young boy he helped his mother in her work as a shopkeeper.  Faced with her recent and untimely death, he had to take over her business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In spite of the fact that he lives in an area which is mainly made up of farmers and craftspeople, Héctor decided to work selling foodstuffs.  Most of his customers are peasants who work in nearby districts and do their shopping every week.  Almost all his sales are made for cash and this allows him to sell at lowers prices.  His average daily sales amount to 400,000 Colombian pesos and his average profit margin is 15%.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is Héctor&apos;s first loan with Fundación Mario Santo Domingo and he plans to invest the money in buying foodstuffs wholesale.  In the not-so-distant future this small businessman plans to convert his business into a supermarket to provide his customers with more convenience.  Héctor combines his work with his studies and, because he is the eldest brother, he drives home to his siblings the need for them to get training in order to become good citizens.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;What Héctor likes most about his work is the permanent contact with people who visit his business, some of whom are good friends.  He dreams of becoming a professional and being able to help the poorest children in his town as a way of honoring his mother&apos;s memory as his mother was a very generous lady.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1100</funded_amount><paid_amount>1100</paid_amount><image><id>673185</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

He started working at a very young age, helping his father on construction jobs.  When he started his own family he continued with the same type of work.  This work allowed him to start building his own house and to buy machinery to install a vulcanizer.  He had always been thinking about starting his own business in the future, so at that moment he started his business.  His son works there as well, and is also a mason.  The business is going well.  Mr. Gutiérrez has been doing this for 15 years now and it is a stable business.  He needs this loan in order to buy necessary materials for his vulcanizer, as well as tires, which he buys in good condition to

She is the mother of six children, four of whom live with her and her long-term partner. To earn a living, she operates a clothing sales business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying pants, t-shirts, blouses, etc. She will save any profits generated as a result of the loan because she wants to buy a house in the future, and her business income is the only means by which she can do so. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;R. is a member of the group known as Cristo me ama 1, 2, 3 (&quot;Christ love me&quot;). Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza&apos;s Dominican and Haitian clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding L. Romana, where the economy is dominated by the sugar cane harvest and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She thanks you for your support. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Note: the woman pictured in the lower left corner was not visible in the group

Los negocios de las señoras están relacionados con el comercio, producción  y servicio, como ser: venta de verduras y macramé, tejido de mantas, ropa de bebé, carnicería y tienda, tienda surtida, venta de coca, tejido de mantas, macramé y ferretería, ladrillos, cemento y estuco.&#10;&#10;La señora Justina presidenta de la asociación “Arco Iris”, actualmente tiene un hogar conformado por su pareja y sus cuatro hijos.&#10;La señora Justina comenta que tiene dos negocios, el primero es la venta de verduras los días jueves y domingo en la zona de Villa Mercedes, en su puesto ella vende diferentes tipos de verduras, en esta época de fin de año, en la que se celebran las fiestas de navidad y año nuevo ella indica que hay mayor venta de choclo (maíz), camote y yuca.  El otro negocio es la venta de artefactos como radios, televisores, bicicletas, de manera ambulante, la estrategia es tomar un solo producto e ir a las zonas comerciales de la ciudad de El Alto (la Ceja de El Alto) y exponer el producto hasta lograr venderlo.&#10;Con el crédito de este ciclo la señora Justina indica que comprará verduras para su puesto y radios, televisiones, bicicletas.&#10;</es><en>The &quot;Arco Iris&quot; (&quot;Rainbow&quot;) communal bank is starting out on its first borrowing cycle, and meets in the Cascada community centre. There are 9 members. The bank&apos;s committee is made up of the president, Señora Justina, the treasurer, Señora Soledad, and Ericka as secretary. The women&apos;s businesses relate to commerce, production, or service industries, and include: selling vegetables and handicrafts, weaving blankets, selling baby clothes, a butcher&apos;s shop and grocery, a grocery store, selling coca leaves, making and selling handicrafts, and selling hardware, bricks and cement.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Señora Justina, the president of the &quot;Arco Iris&quot; communal bank, has built a home with her partner and their 4 children. She states that she has two businesses: the first is selling vegetables, on Thursdays and Sundays, in the Villa Mercedes area. At her stall she sells different types of vegetables, and at this time of year, when people are celebrating Christmas and New Year, she reports increased sales of corn, squashes and yucca. The other business is selling goods such as radios, televisions, and bicycles. The way she sells these is to take one single item and go to the commercial districts of the city of La Ceja de El Alto, and expound the item until she succeeds in selling it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan Señora Justina says she will buy vegetables for her stall, as well as radios, televisions, and bicycles.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2025</funded_amount><paid_amount>2025</paid_amount><image><id>673245</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home

The businesses of these women are in merchandise, production and service: toy sales, sewing traditional dresses, toys, cheese sales, vegetable sales, sausages, potato sales, and sewing tablecloths. The directors board is made of the president, Julia, the treasurer, Marcelina, and as secretary, Martha. Many of the women say that they already have experience working with loans and also say that they know each other well, which gives them confidence that this cycle will end successfully.

Since she was a little girl she has been farming; she learned all the farming techniques back then.  Today, together with her husband, she grows potatoes and also raises small farm animals like, guinea pigs that are sold at the local livestock markets in her area.  She considers guinea pig sales profitable because income is more frequent whereas she has to wait several months until harvest time to get benefits from farming.  For the time being, she will continue to strengthen her crops as well as increase the number of animals she has.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is her loan #2 from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support.

She lives in Puente Piedra and belongs to the group “Nuevo Amanecer” (“New Dawn”). Ever since Jina arrived in Lima over 30 years ago from Iquitos, her homeland, Jina began selling seasonings that she bought and packaged, and sold to different markets in the district. Little by little, Jina’s sales increased and she invested more in her business and was able to sell her merchandize to markets more distant from her area. With the sales, she was able to fix her home which she obtained with a lot of hard work to give greater comfort to her children. At present, Jina is happy to be a part of this group since she is able to have work capital to be able to keep expanding her business and save enough to be able to have her own stall where she can work with more space and comfort for her job. The loan will be used to buy merchandize for her business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2650</funded_amount><paid_amount>2650</paid_amount><image><id>673322</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To buy merchandize for her business.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Carabayllo-Lima</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-11.853333 -77.037778</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>93</partner_id><posted_date>2010-12-22T04:20:11Z</posted_date><loan_amount>2650</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Julia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Gladys Alejandrina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Elizabeth Cristina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Yuliana</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Nelly</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Jina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Arturo</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Luz Angelica</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-12-14T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>7400</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>2650</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-14T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1480</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-14T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1480</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1480</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1480</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1480</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>530</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>530</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>530</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>530</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>530</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>530</amount><local_amount>1480</local_amount><processed_date>2011-01-14T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-02-16T02:51:13Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1488.24</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>191408694</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>530</amount><local_amount>1480</local_amount><processed_date>2011-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-03-15T11:36:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1488.24</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>195826978</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>530</amount><local_amount>1480</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-15T10:46:47Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1488.24</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201269239</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>530</amount><local_amount>1480</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T10:45:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1488.24</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206136119</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>530</amount><local_amount>1480</local_amount><processed_date>2011-05-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-06-15T10:58:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1488.24</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>211208599</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-12-26T04:17:59Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-06-15T10:58:06Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>260288</id><name>Dionicio</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Dionisio tiene 28 años, vive con su esposa y sus 2 hijos en su casa propia.

Por otro lado, también se dedica a la crianza de animales menores, adquiriéndolos a un menor precio, luego de un tiempo los engorda y los comerciales a un precio mayor, así puede generarse ganancias mientras espera la cosecha de sus productos. Todas estas actividades le han servido para sostener a su familia y considera rentable la venta de animales sin embargo seguirá dedicándose a la agricultura porque llega a tener ingresos en mayor cantidad después de esperar por varios meses y eso le favorece para incrementar mas su capital. Es su primer crédito que tiene con MFP, aunque como socio pasivo de su grupo estuvo anteriormente esta muy contento de  saber que tiene un apoyo financiero. Agradece  a aquellas personas que serán gestoras del préstamo que solicita ya que  le será  muy útil en el progreso de su actividad económica. Con el crédito que solicita, lo invertirá en la compra de fertilizantes y abono, para poder mejorar la producción de maíz. &#10;&#10;</es><en>Dionisio is 28 years old; he lives in his own home with his wife and 2 children. All of his life he has been tied to agricultural work and presently he grows potatoes, corn, peas, broad beans, and mashua (an edible tuber, which is eaten as a root vegetable) among other products. His wife is his main source of help. Dionisio also raises small animals by getting them at a less price and after some time he fattens them up and sells them at a higher price and is able to have greater earnings while he waits for the harvest of his products. All of these activities have helped him support his family and considers that selling animals is more profitable but still works as a farmer because it helps him have more revenue after having to wait for several months. This is first loan with MFP (Kiva’s field partner) even though he has been an inactive member of his group but now is happy to know that he has financial support. Dionisio is grateful to those people who will help him with his loan since it will be very helpful for him to progress in his job. With the loan, he will buy fertilizers and manure to be able to improve his corn production.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>673329</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To buy fertilizers and manure.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>HUANCAYO</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-12.066667 -75.233333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2010-12-22T04:20:11Z</posted_date><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Dionicio </first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-11-25T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>2000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2010-12-31T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-05-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-06-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-07-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-09-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-02-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-10-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-11-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>725</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>725</amount><local_amount>2000</local_amount><processed_date>2011-09-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-10-15T09:47:28Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2035.8</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>232850501</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-12-22T08:22:38Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-10-15T09:47:28Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>260289</id><name>Mirtha Del Socorro</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Mirtha es una madre dedicada a su familia, comerciante de ropa y cosmético con tres años en las ventas.&#10;Ha sido muy trabajadora pues ha tenido que apoyar a sus hijos ya que no cuenta con el apoyo del padre.

Claribel lives with her husband and has 3 children between the ages of 15 and 18.  Her income, along with her husband&apos;s, has been able to support her household and her family.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since she was a young girl from the town of Bellavista in the department of Magdalena, she has had to work.  In the beginning she stayed with her aunt and worked as a domestic employee until she was 24 years old.  Now, 20 years later, she knows that all this was a great experience that forged her character so that she would be able to venture into business for herself. Her first business was making cheese, whey, butter and bollo [a tamale like dish] in remembrance of her homeland.    She prepares the most delicious dairy products served with amasijos D. maíz [corn tortillas].  Lastly, she finished setting up her small restaurant when she was able to buy a house and establish it there.  For the comfort of her customers she has tables and chairs and recently, she has been considering buying a heated case that costs $340,000 COP because she sells 50 lunches and 200 fried items daily.  Also, she needs large quantities of raw materials because she knows that her sales will increase at the end of the year.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This will be her 15th loan with Fundación Mario Santo Domingo, an organization that has supported her from her humble beginnings, as much at the business level through the loans she has received, as through the training that has helped her immensely.  She says that this is the business that she has dreamed of, but every day she wants to strengthen it so that she can continue supporting her children&apos;s education.  Her dream is to take vacations with her husband to the San Andres Islands, a beautiful place where the beach, the breeze and the sea will allow her to rest her body and mind and will be a second honeymoon at 44 years old.

Mauan, Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 51 years old, married and has 4 adult children. Sally owns &amp; operates a vegetable selling business. She has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2009, Sally joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Sally is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>671041</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits &amp; Vegetables</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>to purchase new items to expand her product offering</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>Brgy.

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Visitacion S. is from the village of Sto. Domingo, Echague, Isabela. She is 30 years old. Visitacion is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Visitacion is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Visitacion owns and operates a general store, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Visitacion has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 4500 PHP a month from these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Visitacion joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Visitacion has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Visitacion is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Visitacion&apos;s third loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family&apos;s income. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1750</funded_amount><paid_amount>1750</paid_amount><image><id>672566</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase additional products to sell</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>Sto.

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Victoria T. is from the village of Mabantad, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 40 years old. Victoria is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Victoria is married and has 3 school-aged children. She owns &amp; operates a general store where she sells food &amp; daily use products. Victoria is just starting this business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Victoria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory &amp; provide working capital. This will be her first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to supplement her family&apos;s income. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>672459</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

He is married and has four children. After graduating from college and serving in the army, he worked at the local cable plant as an enamel engineer.  After the death of his mother, Turatbek moved into his parents’ house in order to take care of his father. Since his family had been engaged in cattle breeding and land cultivating, he decided to continue this activity.  He worked hard, but his earnings did not cover all the expenses for his growing children.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2007, Turatbek decided to start his business selling foodstuffs.  This has become an additional source of income for his family.  He sold part of his cattle business and rented a small shop.  To maintain that shop, he obtained his first loan from Bai Tushum. This loan was  used as intended and repaid without any delay. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Now, Turatbek plans to use this loan for 120,000 KGS to broaden his assortment of goods and renew his shelf stands in the rented shop. In the future, he plans to open his own shop and build a house for his family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that aim to increase employment and meet the interests

She is 49 years old, married and has 3 school-aged children. Lolita owns &amp; operates a general store where she sells a variety of products.

She is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 41 years old, married and has 3 school-aged children. Evelyn owns &amp; operates a vegetable selling business. She has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Evelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Evelyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>125</funded_amount><paid_amount>125</paid_amount><image><id>670865</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits &amp; Vegetables</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>to purchase additional products to sell</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>Sta.

He is 22 years old. Jason is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI.

Jason owns &amp; operates a vegetable selling business. He has been engaged in his business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Jason joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory &amp; provide working capital. He is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be his 2nd loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to supplement his family&apos;s income. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Teresita A. is from the village of Baringin Sur, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 46 years old. Teresita is the group leader of an 8-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Teresita is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Teresita owns &amp; operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling food &amp; daily use products in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 9000 PHP a month for these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2008, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory &amp; use as working capital. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand her  business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2175</funded_amount><paid_amount>2175</paid_amount><image><id>671260</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Valens J. is from the village of Disimuray, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 34 years old. Valens is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Valens is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Valens owns &amp; operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Valens has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP every four months.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Valens joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Valens has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed &amp; other supplies. Valens is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed &amp; other supplies. This loan will be the 2nd  loan taken out by Valens from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>inactive_expired</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><image><id>671307</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

They started this business with the initial sum of 8,000 Kyrgyz Soms. With the revenues generated, they were able to give a good education to their children.  In spite of the expenses of a large family, they managed to expand their herd of cattle.

Mombasa is in the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many, many tourist attraction sites, including the Indian Ocean white beaches. He has been selling second hand clothes for the last five years to the local people and has one employee. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is financial constraints. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well. He is using his loan of Kes 80,000 to buy more clothes to meet the high demand, especially during the Christmas season. He hopes to open up new outlets in the future and even become a wholesaler.

Monthly, she is able to earn an average of 10,000 Philippines pesos (Php).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 21,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching. Angela plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward more profitability.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Angela&apos;s life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*All CCT community partners/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance

She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most important, her customers. Monthly, she is able to earn an average of 8,000 Philippines pesos (PHP).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching. She also plans to charge up her alkaline water business so that it will also become profitable. Lucia plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward more profitability.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lucia&apos;s life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*All CCT community partners/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>673673</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

She lives in Purok San Pedro Beach, Brgy Old Sagay, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Leonisa has been a member of Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, since 1994 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish-vending  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 20,000 PHP. Leonisa is now borrowing 19,500 PHP as additional capital for her fish-vending business. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Leonisa aspires to elevate her family&apos;s living conditions and ensure its future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt; About NWTF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means &apos;honorable&apos;). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them &apos;Dungganon&apos; – a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  buying and selling tobacco and a motorcycle transport business. Her husband, Anastacio, who is 62 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife&apos;s businesses. They have eight children aged between 21 and 42. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Monica joined Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Monica has been gradually lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 9,000 PHP, thus raising the family&apos;s standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing  30,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her tobacco business and maintenance for her motorcycle so that she could continue to save up for future business improvements. Monica L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt; About NWTF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means &apos;honorable&apos;). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them &apos;Dungganon&apos; – a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org.

She lives in Purok Paglaum, Brgy Taba-ao, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Jinky has been a member of Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her networking business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 10,000 PHP. Jinky is now borrowing 16,000 PHP so that she could use it as additional working capital. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 16,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Jinky aspires to elevate her family&apos;s living conditions and ensure its future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt; About NWTF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means &apos;honorable&apos;). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them &apos;Dungganon&apos; – a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. Help NWTF continue its M. to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org.

She is married and has six grown-up children. Her business is located at a busy market in Kakamega, known as Mudete. Kakamega is the region in Kenya known for production of sugar cane and is known as the sugar belt region. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Rose sells cereals like maize to local people. Besides selling maize, she owns a posho mill for making maize flour, which she then sells to the local people. She has been in this business for eight years now and has one employee. She says that this business is profitable and the only major challenge she has is financial constraints. However, she works very hard to make sure her business does well. She is using her loan of 30,000 KES to buy more cereals to expand her business and meet the demands of her customers. In the future, she hopes to expand her business and become a supplier of cereals in the area. She describes herself as polite and ambitious.

She is characterized by her colleagues as a responsible, precise and sociable person.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, salaries of the teachers in rural areas are very low. That’s why Aliyma, with her husband, decided to start their business in cattle breeding and land cultivating. They worked hard and made every effort to develop their farm. After her husband’s death, Aliyma became the only bread-winner for her children, but in spite of many difficulties on her way, she was able to give a good education to all of them.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;Aliyma plans to use this loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz Soms to buy more cattle. With the revenues from the loan, she plans to broaden her farm by means of livestock breeding.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Bai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

She is 40 years old, married and has one adult-aged child. To make a living, Marilou owns and operates a general store selling a variety of different products in the local community. Marilou has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP per month from these activities.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;In 2008, Marilou joined Kiva partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Marilou is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her sixth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About ASKI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>125</funded_amount><paid_amount>125</paid_amount><image><id>673529</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase additional products to sell</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>Sta.

Isabel Sur. She is 25 years old and married. To make a living, Mary Jane owns and operates a general store selling a variety of different products in the local community. Mary Jane has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 3000 PHP per month from these activities.&#10;In 2010, Mary Jane joined Kiva partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Mary Jane is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her 2nd from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. &#10;&#10;About ASKI&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.&#10;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>125</funded_amount><paid_amount>125</paid_amount><image><id>673531</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase additional products to sell</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>Sta.

Merlyn is thankful to ASHI for the loans it has provided since her membership, Merlyn has been able to support her business by purchasing required materials. She hopes to further improve her business in the future through hard work and the continued assistance of Kiva partner, ASHI.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Lack of business capital has encouraged Merlyn to ask for financial support from Kiva lenders. She will be glad if her loan request is granted and she will use the loan wisely to purchase needed supplies for her business. Her hard work and perseverance have laid the groundwork in bettering her life. Her long-term goal is to have her own shoe manufacturing shop someday. Merlyn hopes to maintain the long-term sustainability of her shoe-making business. She is very thankful that Kiva lenders through ASHI are able to share in the poverty alleviation

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Marisol A. is from the village of Santa Isabel Sur. She is 26 years old, married and has three infant-aged children. To make a living, Marisol owns and operates a specialized retail store selling pork, fish, fruits and vegetables in the local community. Marisol has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP per month from these activities.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;In 2010, Marisol joined Kiva partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Marisol is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About ASKI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>673525</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery Store</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase additional products to sell</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>Sta.

The family lives in a residential area called Lakar Mandi in Chichawatni, a small city known for its agriculture industry located in the Punjab province of Pakistan.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nusrat has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah in order for her husband to improve his dried-fruit vending business. He imports dried fruit at cheap rates from northern areas such as Murree and Sawat and sells these to his customers. Nusrat is hopeful that this investment will open new horizons of success for her husband&apos;s business and will help to improve her family&apos;s standard of living.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Nusrat is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her fifth loan application.

Basilisa S. knows this truth and grabs every opportunity that comes her way. Basilisa, 53, reached high school. She is married to Maximiliano, 53, a vendor. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Basilisa presently runs a buy and sell business. She offers her customers mostly footwear (shoes and sandals), fashion accessories, socks and apparel, among other things. She purchases these items at wholesale prices and sells them with minimum mark-up. Having been in this business for at least 20 years, she knows how to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in Kiva partner, CCT*, and, most importantly, her customers. She is able to earn an average monthly income of 10,000 PHP.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;To help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching. She also plans to charge up her alkaline water business so that it will also become profitable. Basilisa plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward greater profitability.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Basilisa&apos;s life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;*All CCT community partners/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans. &#13;&#10;

Rochelle D. C. knows this truth and grabs opportunity as it comes her way. Rochelle, 32, is a single mother of one child who is in elementary school. After finishing high school, Rochelle strived more to sustain their daily needs and to prepare financially for the future of her young child. The family lives in Pasay City, Philippines.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rochelle runs a sari-sari (variety) store, where she sells items that are needed daily by her neighbors. Products on her shelves range from bars of soap  to candy and energy drinks to rice.  She also manages a food stall where she sells foodstuffs to neighbors. After 18 years in business, Rochelle knows how to pay her dues. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT and, most important, with her customers. She earns an average of 10,000 Philippines pesos (Php) per month.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php11,000 loan. She intends to use this money to replenish the inventory of her store for the Christmas season and to purchase raw meat and other ingredients needed for her food vending business.  Rochelle plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward more profitability.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rochelle&apos;s life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*All CCT community partners/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans. &#13;&#10;

Maricel B. knows this truth and grabs every opportunity that comes her way. Maricel, 36, attended college and now is married to Salvador, who works as a branch manager of a pizza chain in town.  Maricel works hard to help her husband earn for their daily needs and prepare financially for the future of their elementary grade child. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Maricel currently runs a sari-sari (variety) store, in which she sells items that are needed daily by neighbors in her community. Products on her shelves range from soap to candies and energy drinks to rice. Having been at least seven years in business, she knows how to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most important, her customers. Monthly, she is able to earn an average of 10000 Philippines pesos (PHP).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 20000 PHP loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more needed now that the Christmas season is here. Maricel plans to take this opportunity to drive her business toward more profitability.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Maricel is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*All CCT community partners/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans. &#13;&#10;

Arlene P. knows this truth and grabs every opportunity that comes her way. Arlene, 43, finished high school and is happily married to Dindo. They have been blessed with one child who is currently toddling at home. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Arlene presently runs a food stall, where she sells packed meals for breakfast, lunch, and even dinner. Her customers are her neighbors and the local community. Having been at least 10 years in business, she knows how to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most important, her customers. Monthly, she is able to earn an average of 5,000 Philippines pesos (PHP).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP15,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more raw meats, ingredients and other materials. Arlene plans to take this opportunity to drive her business towards more profitability.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Arlene&apos;s life, both business and personal, is never without challenges. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*All CCT community partners/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans. &#13;&#10;

Munther&apos;s father has a taxi that he doesn&apos;t use anymore therefor he decided to fix it and start use it to secure another source of income. Munther took a loan to replace the taxi&apos;s engine.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Munther appears in the picture here next to the taxi.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About this loan product:&#13;&#10;FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent and fence. His youngest son, 21, attends university, his other son is disabled and his wife is retired and stays at home with the son. Maksim operates a taxi service. He began his business in 2008 and has gained much experience over this short period. He has found success with his transportation business and his earnings have enabled him to buy a car and pay off half of it. Maksim is a modest person and says, &quot;I plan to drive my current car for 2 years and after that, I&apos;ll change it for a bigger truck for the future.&quot; He is requesting a 1,200,000 MNT loan in order to pay down the last half owing on his

Gungaabuu supports his entire family by operating a taxi service in his town. At first, he started a coal and firewood sales business in 2006 and stopped in 2009 due to bad sales.

Her husband works as an inspector at the local power station and her son attends university. Darisuren operates a meat and livestock trading business in her town. She started her business in 2000 and has since gained a lot of experience as a businesswoman. Her business currently operates at a stable level and she continues to make progress. Her business earnings have enabled her to buy a car in order to transport her products. She travels through the countryside to buy her meat and livestock and transports them to her town to sell as a retailer. For the future, she plans to buy a larger truck as a result of high transportation costs. Darisuren is a talkative and helpful person and says, &quot;I want to improve my house and enclosure by next year.&quot; She is requesting a 2,200,000 MNT loan to purchase more meat and livestock from the countryside.

From early childhood he had to help his parents in the field where his family cultivated vegetables. After graduating from Pedagogical University with diploma with honors, Abdibait returned home and began to work as a teacher of Russian language and literature at the local school. He was 26 years old, when he married and moved to Kyrgystan.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Using the money he had earned, Abdibait bought a house and rented land for cultivating crops. With the revenues from this activity, he bought a crushing machine and started his business of producing combined feed. He sells his products at the local market and supplies his loyal customers in neighbouring villages. In order to broaden his business and purchase crops for planting, he obtained his first loan from Bai Tushum, which was repaid without any delays.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Abdibait plans to use this loan of 80,000 Kyrgyz Soms to purchase 10 tonnes of barley and 4 tonnes of corn. It will allow him to resell combined feed from these products in winter at higher prices. In the future, Abdibait is planning to give a higher education to his children and build a house for his family. Being a very purposeful and positive person, Abdibait works hard to support his family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased

altas pendientes, se encuentra ubicado el barrio “Manrique La Cruz”, conformado por familias campesinas que llegaron a la ciudad, a causa del desplazamiento al que se vieron sometidas. Y es allí donde se encuentra la microempresa de Luz Mery P. D. quien desde hace dos años decidió hacer de la tradicional arepa su sustento familiar. &#10;&#10;Las arepas de Luz Mery son hechas al carbón lo que le da mejor sabor y hace que sus clientes las prefieran. Estar en pie desde las 5:00 a.m. para iniciar las ventas y soportar el calor que genera el asador y que le produce dolor en sus manos no ha sido impedimento para salir adelante y continuar con su negocio.  &#10;&#10;Como emprendedora y gran visionaria, Luz Mery, sueña con ampliar su negocio hasta tener un restaurante reconocido en el barrio y así mejorar su calidad de vida y la de su familia. &#10;</es><en>The Manrique La Cruz neighborhood is located in the northeast area of Medellin-Colombia.  It is situated among even fields and high slopes.  The neighborhood is comprised of country people who came to the city because of the forced displacement they were subjected to.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is where the small businesswoman, Luz Mery P. D., can be found.    Two years ago she decided to make the traditional “arepa” (flat bread served with various fillings or toppings) to support her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Luz Mery cooks the arepas over charcoal.  This gives them better flavor and her customers prefer her arepas.  She is on her feet starting at 5:00 a.m. in order to begin the sales and to bear the heat generated from the roaster.  This causes pain in her hands, but it has not been an impediment to getting ahead and continuing with her business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As an entrepreneur and a great visionary, Luz Mery dreams of expanding her business until she has a well-known neighborhood restaurant.  That way she will improve her quality of life and that of her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>673982</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Adaptation

She also has a butcher shop in Githurai and earns a profit margin of Kshs.27,617 per month. She is married to Fredrick and together they have three children aged between 9 and 18 years.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is her first loan from KADET LTD after being introduced to KADET by a friend. She plans to use the loan as follows: buy timber worth Kshs.50,000 and use Kshs.30,000 to buy more meat to sell at the butcher shop.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She will use the anticipated profit to re-invest in the businesses, so she will have enough stock to sell to her customers. In the future she hopes to grow her businesses and open another branch of the timber yard.  In the future, she plans to build a house.

González tiene 28 años de edad, vive junto a sus dos hijos y su esposo,  en una zona de Alajuela que ha sido apoyada por instituciones como el Instituto Mixto de Ayuda Social, para mejorar la calidad de vida de las personas. Hace 7 años y por iniciativa propia, comenzó en el comercio vendiendo ropa y otros artículos, con el lapso de los años y gracias al esfuerzo de ella ha crecido, atendiendo otras necesidades de sus clientes, incursionando en la compra de electrodomésticos traídos desde el puerto libre de Golfito. &#10;&#10;Su principal prioridad es apoyar a sus hijos en el estudio; al mismo tiempo ella está llevando los cursos para obtener su título de  la secundaria a distancia; acaba de aprobar el sétimo año. Esto le ha ayudado a mejorar en su negocio y espera en el corto plazo obtener el bachillerato. Este es su primer crédito y llegó a  Fundación Mujer por referencia de una amiga que escuchó la información  en un programa de radio.&#10;&#10;Ella inició su actividad con un préstamo por 25000 colones que su tía le otorgó. Con este adquirió   ropa intima y así inició su negocio. Le ha ido dando vuelta al capital y diversificando su oferta de productos a sus clientes, actualmente realiza ventas por catálogo y va a Golfito a comprar electrodomésticos, los cuales vende a pagos.&#10;&#10; Una vez realizado el estudio de crédito y verificado las diferentes actividades a las que se dedica la clienta  demuestra la capacidad  para cubrir la cuota en el plazo establecido. Además con esta inversión se va a ir a Panamá donde se va a comprar mercadería (ropa principalmente) a un muy buen precio, fortaleciendo así su capital de trabajo para sus otras actividades.&#10;&#10; La clienta tiene un pequeño local en su casa en donde mantiene un pequeño inventario de productos y atiende por las mañanas, después de haber enviado a sus hijos a la escuela, por las tardes realiza exhibiciones en localidades cercanas lo que le ha ayudado a aumentar su clientela, brinda facilidades de pago. Es una actividad que apoya los ingresos del hogar que se complementan con el trabajo de su esposo. Por las noches se dedica a estudiar.&#10;</es><en>María C. González is 28 years old.  She lives with her two children and her husband in an area of Alajuela that has been supported by institutions such as the &apos;Instituto Mixto de Ayuda Social&apos; with the goal of improving residents&apos; quality of life.  Seven years ago, under her own initiative, María set up her business selling clothes and other articles.  Over the years and thanks to her own hard work, she has grown in her business, meeting other needs of her customers, buying electrical appliances from Golfito free port.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;María&apos;s main priority is to support her children in their studies.  At the same time, María herself is taking some distance-learning courses so that she can finish her high school education.  She has just passed her seventh year.  This has helped her to improve her business and she hopes, in the short term, that she will be able to obtain her high school diploma.  This is María&apos;s first loan.  A friend recommended that she approach Fundación Mujer when she heard about the institution on a radio program.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;María started her business with a loan of 25,000 colones that she received from her aunt.  With this money she bought underwear and set up her business.  Her capital has gone around and she has diversified the range of products that she offers to her customers.  She currently makes catalog sales and travels to Golfito to buy electrical appliances which she sells on credit.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We have performed a credit report on the client and verified the different business activities that she carries out.  She shows the ability to make her repayments on time.  She is also planning to use her loan money to travel to Panama where she will buy merchandise (mainly clothes) at a very good price, thereby strengthening her working capital for other activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;María has small premises in her home where she keeps a small inventory of products.  She works there in the mornings after having got her children ready for school.  In the afternoons, she displays her products in nearby towns which has helped her to increase her customer base.  She provides her customers with credit facilities.  María&apos;s activities support her household financially, together with the money her husband makes from his work.  In the evenings, María

de Villa Tejada. Cuenta con nueve integrantes.  Los negocios de las señoras están relacionados con el comercio, producción  y servicio, entre estos tenemos: servicio de lavandería, venta de ropa de bebé, ayudante de albañil, lavado de arena, venta de abarrotes, venta de comida, tejidos de mantas, venta de tennis (zapatos deportivos)&#10;&#10;La mesa directiva está compuesta por la presidenta, la señora Maria Elena, la tesorera, la señora Margarita y como secretaria de actas la señora Sonia. Muchas de las señoras indican que ya tiene experiencia en trabajar con crédito, fueron socias de Pro Mujer durante algunos años y que lo dejaron porque ya no necesitaban, ahora se han visto en la necesidad de contar con un capital para impulsar el negocio o para renovar las herramientas de trabajo.  Este es el caso del la señora María Elena Q., presidenta de la Banca Comunal “Awatiñas”, fue socia durante diez y ocho ciclos. Su negocio es el lavado de arena, ella cuenta que por la zona donde vive pasa un río que trae arena en la época de lluvia.  Ella y algunas otras personas del vecindario hicieron los trámites para que se dieran lugares para lavar la arena a orillas del río. La señora Maria Elena le llama “puesto”, así como un puesto de venta de verduras.   Este es un trabajo pesado, pero rentable.  El crédito de la señora presidenta es de Bs 2000.- y con el mismo ella piensa comprar carretilla, pala, manguera, trinche, picota, manguera, herramientas que necesita por que las que tiene están muy desgastadas.&#10;Cuando se le consulta sobre lo que más le gusta de Pro Mujer, la respuesta es “el crédito”.&#10;</es><en>The Awatiñas Community Bank is starting its first loan cycle in the Villa Tejada Centre. There are nine women in the group, and all have businesses in commerce, production, or service such as a laundry, baby clothing sales, builder’s assistant, sand washing, grocery sales, food sales, weaving shawls, or selling sports footwear.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sra. Maria Elena is president of the Board of Directors, Sra. Margarita is treasurer, and Sra. Sonia is secretary. Many of the women note that they already have experience taking out loans as they have been members of Kiva partner Pro Mujer for several years. They stopped when they no longer needed financial assistance, but now they have seen the need for money to give a boost to their businesses or to buy some new tools.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Such is the case with Señora María Elena Q., president of the Awatiñas Community Bank, who has been a member for eighteen loan cycles. Her job is washing sand. She explains that a river runs through the area where she lives. During the rainy season it carries a lot of sand. María and several other people from the neighbourhood have permits for certain locations on the banks of the river where they can wash the sand. María calls her location a ‘stand’, just as if it were a stand for selling vegetables. It’s hard work but profitable. Her loan of Bs 2000 will be used to buy a wheelbarrow, shovel, hosepipe, fork, and a pickaxe--tools she needs as the ones she owns are worn out. When María is asked what she most likes about Pro Mujer, she replies “the financial assistance”.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2325</funded_amount><paid_amount>2325</paid_amount><image><id>674119</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Construction

She is a public employee in this entity.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She wants the loan to buy pills because she needs to start treatment for gastritis.  The insurance does not cover the soft gel tablets for her to be able to take them.  Also, she will need to buy other medications that the social security does not have.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was a little sad about this, and she expressed that she only wants to have her treatment with the best quality medication.  She wants this so that her kidneys are not affected, and her gastritis is not aggravated.  She is requesting the loan to start her treatment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is happy with the loan that was granted, and she pledges to make her payments on time.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>674149</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Health</activity><sector>Health</sector><use>To start her treatment</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>CUSCO</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-13.518333 -71.978056</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>119</partner_id><posted_date>2010-12-23T15:20:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Irma Gregoria</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-12-16T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>600</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>143.43</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-14T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>147.73</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>152.16</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-15T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>156.68</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>143.43</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>147.73</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>152.16</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>156.68</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>143.43</amount><local_amount>143.43</local_amount><processed_date>2011-01-31T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-02-16T01:41:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>143.43</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>191376094</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>147.73</amount><local_amount>147.73</local_amount><processed_date>2011-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-03-15T11:21:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>147.73</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>195793549</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>152.16</amount><local_amount>152.16</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-15T10:17:57Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>152.16</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201235305</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>156.68</amount><local_amount>156.68</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T10:17:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>156.68</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206101530</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-12-23T18:00:32Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-05-15T10:17:40Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>260522</id><name>Silvia Karina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Silvia de 30 años, vive en una zona periurbana llamada Fortín es madre soltera tiene tres hijos de 11, 8 y 4 años de edad que estudian en una escuela del gobierno (aparecen en la foto).

She lives in San Francisco Gotera in the Morazán department.  She lives with her eight year old daughter and her family because she is a single mother.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She learned the business from her mother, and the business is her own.  Her schedule starts at 7:00 a.m.  She does this work out of the necessity.  She needs to help her daughter and give her what she needs in order to grow in a healthful way and to be able to go to school.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rosalina is requesting a loan to buy ingredients like corn, fresh cheese, and “chicharrón” (fried pork rinds).  These are the ingredients she needs in order to make sales.  This loan will help her keep an adequate amount of ingredients.  Also, she will have to produce more as she tries to increase the customer demand.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her dreams are to get ahead in the business, to grow and improve her quality of life and that of her family, and to give her daughter an education and the necessary

She is asking for a loan in order to buy the things she needs to make sales, like sausage, condiments, tomatoes.  The loan will help her make purchases in greater quantity and thereby get a better price from the wholesalers, meaning the possibility of seeing greater profits.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She dreams of growing her business and through it being able to make an income that would permit her to save and to buy land to build her own home, improving the quality of life for her children.

He lives with his wife and their son in his own house. Since he was young, he learned farming skills. Today, he farms independently as seven years have passed dedicating himself to sowing potato and other products on a larger scale. On many occassions, his wife and their children help him with this work. Additionally, he raises animals like chicken and guinea pigs that feed his family and also generate some income when sold at the local market. When Victor realized that selling his harvest was profitable, it encouraged him to intensify his work since he hoped in the future to buy machinery and hire workers. This is his loan number four with MFP. He is very happy to know that he has financial support. Additionally, he is happy to be part of his community bank because all the members are people he knows, are responsible and very unified.

This area is home to a large dam known as the &quot;Dam Tepetitlan.&quot; Because of the dam, they are people that are dedicated to fishing chub to sell at the market. What these people do is clean and fry, or even stew them or make tamales to sell.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In this group, there is a member that has the job which has been mentioned. She is named Celestina M. E.. She is a housewife but she goes fishing and prepares the chub in different ways.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The &quot;Las Fresas&quot; group has 13 hard-working female members. They are Mazahuas women. They speak this indigenous language which is part of the cultulre of the San Felipe del Progreso village, and not only does their language demonstrate their culture but also their dress.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They named their group this way because they say that they couldn&apos;t find another name. They had mentioned various but all were already taken by other groups until one of the members said &quot;las Fresas.&quot; This caused them to laugh and so they used this name, as well as to sound a little original beside the other groups.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The names of the women are the following:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;1.-Maria S. M., She is 40 years old and has a grocery store.&#13;&#10;2.-Irma G. G., She is 30 years old and she buys, raises and sells sheep.&#13;&#10;3.- Marcelina C. Sáncehez, , She is a young woman of 20 years and she is dedicated to raising chicken to sell.&#13;&#10;4.-Juana M. C., She is 45 years old and is dedicated to buying and selling fattened sheep.&#13;&#10;5.-Veronica S. M., She is 19 and raises sheep.&#13;&#10;6.-Antonia J. S. is 36 years old and has a grocery store.&#13;&#10;7.-Lorenza G. C., She is 54 years old and is dedicated to raising calves to sell.&#13;&#10;8.-Rosa V. N. is 42 years old and is dedicated to raising chicken and sheep.&#13;&#10;9.-Paula P. G. is 38 years old and is dedicated to raising animals.&#13;&#10;10.- Irene T.

E. is 27 years old and is dedicated to fishing and selling chubs prepared ready to eat.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The community is very humble in general. All of the people come from scarce resources. They don&apos;t have secondary education. The majority of people don&apos;t know how to read. They are only dedicated to farming and raising animals. The men know masonry work and many leave to work in cities in Mexico or the U.S.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Maria S. M.  is head of the list of names. In the photo, she appears clothed in a white sweater, a typical Mazahua blue dress with red stripes and sky blue socks. She is the second in the photo from left to right.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Maria is 40 years old. She lives in her own house with her husband. In total, she had eight children. However, one of them died. Now there are only seven children: 4 boys and 3 girls. At the moment, one 11 year old boy depends on her. He is in elementary school. Her other children work and one has his own family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mari&apos;s activity is raising calves. She is going to use her loan to pay two two corn fields of grass that they rented. They occupy the fields to give food to their animals. She also wants to buy a calf.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mari tells us that one of the difficulties of the months from April until September is feeding her animals since she doesn&apos;t have land and it is the rainy season. What she does is pay a monthly rent for each animal so they can eat the pasture and the others can go to a farm that is near the community.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mari&apos;s wish is to be able to have a space for her animals like land to farm and not to buy the corn field which is expensive. She also wants to be able to guard the animals. Mari also says that when she sells an animal, it&apos;s cheap. Her goal is to sell them at a good price so she gets something back for her investment.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>4875</funded_amount><paid_amount>4875</paid_amount><image><id>673328</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Animal
