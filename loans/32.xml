Moreover, her family situation forced her to find ways to provide a stable income. Her son had been very sick for a while and Antonina had to work day and night to earn enough so she could buy necessary medication for him. Her perseverance, integrity, openness and natural cheerfulness have been key success factors for her business as they have ensured friendly relationships with her customers who willingly became her loyal clients.

In the summertime she sells swimming suits and t-shirts, and in the wintertime she sells denim clothing and coats. Irina rents a little stand in the market for her business. She has also been able to put up a tent just across from her kiosk which gives her additional retail space. The business climate has changed a lot for Irina since she started selling back in the 1990’s. Today, there is much more competition from larger stores and shopping malls that did not exist when she was starting out. Irina has persevered through the changes that have taken place, doing the best she can to earn a living. Irina is a widow and has been raising her 17 year old son. He recently was able to start working as well which has brought some much needed income for the family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Irina has requested a loan to help purchase some new inventory for her business. She would like to begin stocking items such as backpacks, skirts, and shirts that will be popular as students head back to school in September. We are happy to have this opportunity to continue assisting Irina with her business and

After working there for some time his health began to deteriorate and he was forced to quit. In the meantime, his wife had begun working at the market trying to make ends meet and so Yuryi decided to join her.

She lives with her parents. Both parents work as controllers at Ispharinskiy Chemical Plant and receive scanty pay. Maftuna’s business provides a sizable contribution to her family’s income. Maftuna sells fried sunflower seeds, chewing gum, cigarettes, and other small items at the town’s bus terminal. The business is doing well, because there are plenty of buyers at the station. To buy her goods, Maftuna travels to neighboring Uzbekistan. She is a Tajik citizen and it is not easy for her to cross the border. Because the goods cost less in Uzbekistan, Maftuna must continue her trips in spite of many difficulties. Maftuna has been a MicroInvest borrower for half a year. She used her loan to expand her business slightly and purchase the necessary amount of goods. Now, many of the goods that Maftuna is selling have gone up in price. She plans to use the new loan to purchase more goods.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Мафтуне 19 лет. Она живет с родителями. Отец и мать работают контролерами на Исфаринском химическом заводе и получают мизерную по нынешним временам заработную плату. Бизнес, которым занимается Мафтуна, вносит весомый вклад в семейный бюджет. Мафтуна продает жареные семечки, жевательную резинку, сигареты и другие мелкие товары на городском автовокзале. Торговля идет хорошо, так как покупателей очень много. Для закупки товара Мафтуна ездит в соседний Узбекистан. Для нее как гражданина Таджикистана существует проблема пересечения границы, но товар там стоит дешевле и Мафтуне приходится несмотря на трудности ездить в Узбекистан. &#13;&#10;&#9;В Микроинвест Мафтуна кредитуется полгода. С помощью займа она намного расширила свой бизнес, закупила необходимое количество товара. Сейчас многие товары, которые она продает, повысились в цене. Новый займ она хочет потратить на закупку товаров.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>53022</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to

type="list"><language>ru</language></languages><texts><ru>When the life conditions became completely unbearable, Salima went to sell on a market. This was 6 years ago. For the last several years, Salima’s husband has been away working as a seasonal laborer in Russia. He earns very little. The irregular money transfers that he sends are not enough to pay for necessities. Salima has 3 children. One of her daughters is mentally retarded and sits at home. Salima tries anything that might bring extra income. She specializes in sale of dried fruits (apricots and prunes). During the summer, when melons and watermelons appear on the market, Salima switches to sell them. Salima’s older daughter helps her mother to sell. Over the 5 months of being a MicroInvest borrower, Salima demonstrated that MicroInvest loans made a noticeable difference in her business. Salima plans to continue her relationship with MicroInvest, as the loans she receives help her sustain her business.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Когда условия жизни Салимы стали совсем невыносимыми она вышла на базар торговать. Это произошло 6 лет назад. Ее муж уже несколько лет в России на заработках, но зарабатывает очень мало. Деньги высылает нерегулярно, и присланных не хватает на жизнь. У Салимы 3 детей, одна из дочерей умственно отсталая в развитии, и сидит дома. Салима старается заниматься всем тем что приносит прибыль. Основная направленность – это продажа сухофруктов (чернослив, абрикосы). В летний сезон, когда на базаре появляются арбузы и дыни Салима, переходит на их продажу. В торговле ей помогает ее старшая дочь. &#13;&#10;Кредитуется  5 месяцев и за это время займы Микроинвест внесли заметный вклад в ее бизнес. Салима и дальше собирается сотрудничать с Микроинвест, так как займы помогают ей поддержать ее бизнес.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>53024</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Business

B., 43, weaves traditional Mayan women&apos;s clothing, including shawls, huipiles, and head dressings which are quite unique in this region. The huipiles are special women&apos;s tops that can take up two months to make, depending on the details and the design.  Her customers are the women of the town who are in need of a new huipil and will pay up to US$275 for her weavings. She has taught all her daughters this traditional Mayan art that has been created in the same way for 400 years.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Magdalena lost her husband four months ago after a four-year battle with tuberculosis. She now is the sole support of her 6 children and she somehow manages to send all her children to school, except for the youngest who will attend next year. Magdalena struggles with some stomach problems; the kids are generally healthy, but have not come to terms with the loss of their dad. In order to purify their drinking water they boil it. They do not have electricity and she cooks by wood. She speaks Ixil, the Mayan language spoken in Nebaj. Unlike many people, she does own enough land to grow corn to feed her family.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With this loan she will buy more yarn to weave  and some stock for the small store she is developing. Her ultimate goal is to weave enough so she can purchase enough product  to fully stock her little store. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Written by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva

Ее муж работает в «нонвойхоне» (цехе по производству национального таджикского хлеба - лепешки). Заработка мужа хватает на питание семьи. Для покупки чего-либо большего денег на хватает. Муазамхон несколько лет назад решила заняться бизнесом. Постепенно расширяя бизнес она арендовала торговое место в магазине. Сейчас ассортимент ее товаров включает в себя детскую одежду и обувь для всех возрастов. За товаром она ездит раз в неделю на оптовый рынок расположенный в 170 км от ее дома. У Муазамхон много постоянных клиентов и прибыль от бизнеса вносит весомый вклад в семейный бюджет. Наступает пора сезона школьных форм и Муазамхон планирует получить займ для закупа этих форм.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, Muazzamhon took her first MicroInvest loan to process and dry apricots. The loan brought Muazzamhon a nice profit, so she decided to do it again. Muazzamhon, 39 is married and has 4 children—2 boys and 2 girls. Her husband works on “nonvoykhone” (a bakery that produces Tajik traditional bread—&lt;i&gt;lavash&lt;/i&gt;). The money that Muazzamhon’s husband makes is enough only to buy food and nothing else. A few years ago, Muazzamhon started her business. Gradually expanding, she rented a trading spot in a store. Now, Muazzamhon sells clothing for children and shoes for all ages. Once a week, she travels to buy her goods from a wholesaler located 170 km away from her home. Muazzamhon has many regular customers and the profit that her business makes constitutes a sizable contribution to her family’s budget. School season is approaching, and Muazzamhon asks for a loan to order school uniforms.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1100</funded_amount><paid_amount>1100</paid_amount><image><id>53033</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to

Ее бизнес начался 4 года назад, когда она впервые вышла торговать. Вначале она помогала матери а затем и сама стала привозить и продавать товар. Ее ассортимент включает в себя резиновую летнюю обувь, которую она продает в летний сезон. Зимой она переходит на торговлю зимней детской одеждой. Ей помогает 2 младшие сестренки. Полученную прибыль она частью вкладывает в расширение своего бизнеса, а остальное тратит на семейные расходы. В этом заключается ее вклад в семейный бюджет. В Микроинвест она кредитуется уже полгода и ее бизнес заметно продвинулся. Сейчас она собирается и дальше расширять свой бизнес и хочет получить новый займ.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firuza, 23 is not married and lives with her parents. She started her business 4 years ago, when she first began to sell. Initially, she helped her mother, but then Firuza began to deliver and sell her goods independently. Her assortment of goods includes rubber shoes, which she sells in the summer. In the winter, Firuza switches to selling winter clothing for children. Firuza gets help from her two younger sisters. She invests a share of her profits into expansion of her business and spends the rest to cover her family&apos;s expanses. Since becoming a MicroInvest customer half a year ago, Firuza has shown a noticeable progress in business. Now, she needs a new loan to continue business expansion.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>53064</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Business

Это приносит доход, на который живет семья. Ее старшая дочь должна выйти замуж,  а сына она собирается женить. Для этого нужны деньги. Часть прибыли от торговли она откладывает на свадьбу. Чтобы получить дополнительную прибыль она получила займ в Микроинвест. На полученный займ она закупила семечки и сигареты.

Her husband has no permanent employment and does odd jobs. To help him  provide for the family  4 years ago Raihona decided to start selling children&apos;s clothing and footwear. Profits from this business help with many expenses for the kids and other family needs. Raihona has no permanent  trading place. She travels to the neighboring villages to sell  her goods. Previously her husband took out a loan from Microinvest and used it to buy, process and dry apricots. Dried apricots were sold with good profits. Raihona is applying for another loan to farther expand her business.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by [Elena Sheyner, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Райхона живет со своим мужем и с детьми в кишлаке Лаккон. Ее муж работает разнорабочим и постоянного места работы у него нет. У Райхоны 4 детей. Чтобы поддержать мужа Райхона 4 года назад решила заняться бизнесом. В качестве товара для продажи она выбрала детскую одежду и обувь. Прибыль от бизнеса помогает решить проблемы семьи, совершаются многие расходы на детей. Постоянного места для торговли нет и она ездит по окрестным кишлакам. В Микроинвест первый займ получил ее муж и он был потрачен на переработку и сушку абрикосов. Переработанный абрикос продали и получили хорошую прибыль. Далее Райхона решила взять займ на расширение своего бизнеса. Сейчас она собирается получить новый займ на дальнейшее расширение бизнеса.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>53088</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

She is 48 years old and teaches in a primary school in the afternoons and in the evenings, she is busy making masitas (bread), biscochos, and empanadas. Her daughters help her to supplement their income, for she is a single mother. The loan would be to buy more baking materials in bulk since up till now, she has bought them by pound, which is more expensive and reduces her profits as well.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is her first time with IMPRO but her wish to increase her sales qualifies her for this loan.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Regina vive en casa propia con sus dos hijas en la calle Simeón Roncal de la zona de Alto san Pedro en la ciudad de La Paz. Tiene 48 años de edad, es profesora de primaria durante la tarde y por las noches se dedica a la elaboración de masitas, como ser pan, biscochos, empanadas, queques con ayuda de sus hijas, para mejorar sus ingresos ya que es madre soltera.&#13;&#10;El crédito que solicita es para comprar material en cantidad ya que a la fecha ella compra solo por libras lo cual hace que sus costos sean un poco altos y su ganancia se vea reducida por esta situación.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No tiene antecedente con IMPRO, pero su deseo de mejorar sus ingresos la califica para acceder a un crédito.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>53098</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Bakery</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>Ines lives with her husband and four children in their own home since December 14 in the high altitude area of Llojeta in La Paz, Bolivia.  Her husband works as a taxi driver and brings home 50 Bolivian pesos.  With their savings, they bought some wool of a camelid and alpaca (like llamas).  Ines started to spin the wool into blankets and would like to offer them for sale. She is looking for a good market to sell her products.  Currently, she has orders for her blanket; she spins wool (converting the wool into fine thread) and has another helper that ultimately weaves it into a blanket.  Ines brings it to a finish with braids and other designs, ready to be weaved. The loan she is looking is to buy more wool so she can rely on this occupation.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is her first time with IMPRO but her business potential leads us to believe that Ines needs an opportunity.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ines vive en casa propia con su esposo y sus cuatro hijos en la calle desde 14 de diciembre de la zona de alto Llojeta de la ciudad de La Paz; el esposo trabaja con un taxi llevando a su casa una renta de 50 Bs. Con sus ahorros compraron lana de vicuña y alpaca e Ines empezó a hilar y se animo a ofrecer mantas, hallando un buen mercado para sus productos. Actualmente ella realiza mantas a pedido; ella hila (es el proceso de convertir la lana en hilo fino) y tiene otra persona que teje la manta. Ines le entrega el acabado fino con trencilla y otros, listo para el proceso del tejido. El crédito que solicita es para comprar más lana y poder seguir con su actividad. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No tiene antecedente con IMPRO, pero su buena disposición para con su negocio nos llevan a creer que Ines necesita una oportunidad. &lt;p&gt;</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>53101</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To buy more raw material</use><location><country_code>BO</country_code><country>Bolivia</country><town>La Paz</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-16.5 -68.15</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>48</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-08T09:25:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ines</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-08-22T15:14:39Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-22T09:21:28Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-13T14:23:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>57512</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-22T09:21:25Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-13T14:23:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>70754</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-22T10:24:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-13T14:23:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>85133</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>98</amount><local_amount>98</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-13T14:23:54Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-13T14:23:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>98</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>96619</payment_id><comment>Ines wants to pay her loan off earlier.

She opened the restaurant over seven years ago in hopes that locals would enjoy the new style of food.  Nancy has been a vegetarian for nine years and thinks it is a healthy way of life.  “Carne D. soya” or soy meat was not a popular choice at first, but recently many customers have caught on to the delicious and nutritious meals.  The restaurant serves traditional Peruvian food, with the exchange of soy for meat.  She has six children, two of whom live with her and four of whom are on their own.  Nancy has been a loyal member of FINCA for 4 years and hopes to receive a next loan of $500 to purchase more tables and chairs to seat and serve her increasing number of customers.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>53122</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase more tables and chairs.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Ayacucho</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-13.158333 -74.223889</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>70</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-08T09:25:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Nancy Maria</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-08-22T16:08:37Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-22T09:22:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-22T10:18:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>57536</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-22T09:22:36Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-22T10:18:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>70781</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-22T10:26:42Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-22T10:18:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>85166</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-22T10:18:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-22T10:18:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>101238</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-08T16:08:37Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-22T10:18:50Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>15705</id><name>Emma</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;h4&gt;Business Description &lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Emma sells food items and sundries from a small shop located on a main street.

She sells ‘abarrotes’, also known as packings or cooking supplies.  Store owners, restaurant owners, women, men, and children all purchase goods from Decina’s business. Daily clients visit her stand with a smile knowing that Decina sells products of good quality and fair prices.  Seven days a week from 7am to 9pm surrounded by bags of split peas, dried corn, flour, eggs, rice, pastas, beans, seasonings, and more, Decina rarely has a break.  These are the staple goods of every Peruvian home.  Though, Decina says that the most common purchases are rice, noodles, and sugar. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Decina says that her stand has been busy every day for the past seven years that she has owned it.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Maria has lived her whole life in the presence of fish. Her father was a fisherman, and caught trout in the local rivers near Trujillo, Peru, where she grew up. When she turned 20 years old, Maria opened a small “cevicheria,” adjacent to her home, and served the trout, cooked without heat by marinating the meat in limejuice. Seven years ago, her husband abandoned her for another woman, and Maria was left to care for her 3 children alone.&lt;p&gt;Deciding to make a fresh start, Maria moved to Ayacucho, Peru, where she had distant relatives. She used her savings to rent a counter section at the central market, where she sells her ceviche and sodas to up to 50 customers a day. She can be found at her stall, which is equipped with a sink and preparation area, 7 days a week, from about 9 am until quite late at night, or until her supply of fish runs out. Dressed in the traditional white chef hat and apron, Maria exudes experience and professionalism. A steady stream of customers visits her kiosk, and business really picks up during the lunch hour. She serves a generous portion of the diced fish, with potatoes, onions, and a lettuce garnish.&lt;p&gt;For her next loan, Maria hopes to receive US$500. For now, her stall is modestly equipped with the most basic utilities. She would use the money from this loan for a small refrigeration device that she could install under the preparation counter. For now, Maria must store the fish, which comes frozen twice a week from Lima, at her home, and prepare the ceviche there as well. With refrigeration at her kiosk she would not have to carry the heavy dishes to work, and would be able to avoid the risk of running out of food on a busy day.&lt;p&gt;Maria V. belongs to a village bank called “Ayni” which is a quechua (native language) word that means “I help you now, you help me later”.  So Maria has friends in her village bank like Benita Sierra.  Maria and Benita are expecting together a total loan of US$ 900.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>53126</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase a small refrigeration device</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Ayacucho</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-13.158333 -74.223889</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>70</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-23T21:00:54Z</posted_date><loan_amount>900</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maria</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-09-06T23:38:21Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>900</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>900</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>225</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-06T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>225</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-06T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>225</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-06T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>225</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>225</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>225</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>225</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>225</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>225</amount><local_amount>225</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-07T09:24:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-07T10:20:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>225</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>64488</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>225</amount><local_amount>225</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-07T10:26:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-07T10:20:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>225</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>78019</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>225</amount><local_amount>225</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-07T10:28:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-07T10:20:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>225</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>93237</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>225</amount><local_amount>225</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-07T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-07T10:20:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>225</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>111271</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-23T23:38:21Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-07T10:20:39Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>15709</id><name>Julia</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Far from downtown Ayacucho, Peru, on an unpaved road frequented by goats, chickens, and the occasional car, lives Julia H. T.. No more than 5 feet tall, Julia has a warm smile and plenty of jokes to tell. She opens the small, nondescript metal door to her grocery store that she has owned for more than 12 years. She has always worked in this same storefront near her home, but the shop today is far from where she began.&lt;p&gt;Julia is a busy mother of 7 children. Her husband is often away, working in agriculture in the “chacra,” or the countryside. Julia started selling beverages, such as water and soda, to supplement her husband’s meager income. Over the past decade, however, she has expanded the products she offers bit by bit. After beverages, she moved on to household cleaning supplies and snacks. A few years later, she began selling spices and canned goods. Most recently, she has begun selling rice, sugar, and flour, which have turned out to be her most popular items. She also has a large basket of kumquats, which she grows and picks in her own garden. These small orange fruits are very popular with the neighborhood whenever they are in season.&lt;p&gt;Julia hopes to receive a loan of $500. She would like to use this money to purchase more inventory of all of her items, to prevent selling out. She would also like to start selling fresh milk, which she thinks there is a demand for.

He has been faithfully working in this business for seven years. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Currently, Vasiliy’s daily income is about $40-50. An economical diesel engine in his car helps him reduce his operating costs and add to his bottom line. The fifteen loans that Vasiliy has received from Nadiya Ukraine have helped to promote stability and growth in his business.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Vasiliy is asking for a loan of $1,000 to help purchase a newer, more comfortable car for long distance trips around the Ukraine. Vasiliy decided to become self-employed when the auto company he had worked for went bankrupt.

He has always been interested in machinery and technologies. That is why he decided to start his own small repair business. Andrei owns a maintenance shop providing car repair services in the town of Ugriniv, Ivano-Frankivsk region. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Andrei has been in this business for five years. Flexibility, customer friendly service and deferred payment options are some of the reasons his business has been so popular in the community. “Nadiya Ukraine” lending services have promoted the growth and profitability of his venture. Andrei has received and promptly repaid three loans with no defaults. Currently, he makes about $2,000 of monthly net profit. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Andrei is requesting a loan of $1,200 to buy 600 liters of motor oil for his maintenance operation. He is hoping that offering different types of refined oils, as well as a full range of other petroleum products, will increase his sales and allow him to provide better service for his customers and enhance their vehicles&apos; performance. We believe Andrei’s focused approach to business and his diligent hard-work will help him repay this loan on time and expand his business as a

She knows that she can earn some money by making ice blocks everyday to sell in the school in her village. She also knows that apart from school children, other people will want to buy her ice-pops. A week&apos;s worth of sales earns her $100. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Naomi also works on a plantation and, being single, her siblings are always eager to help her out. She grows different varieties of root crops and takes them to the market where their sale earns her $200. All her hard work has paid off well for her and she is excited and hoping to ask for more financial assistance from SPBD. In the future she plans to expand her plantation and also her food stall. She is asking for a $1,200 loan to expand and buy more material for her current ice-block

A hardworking mother of 12, Julia knows how to handle the pack, using harsh words and even sticks when the need be. Her sturdy build and serious features mask a gentle, mothering woman who is both business savvy and nurturing, depending on the circumstance.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Julia speaks only Quechua, the native language of the indigenous Andean people. Every week she travels 13 hours in a crowded truck into the rural zones of Peru. She then spends three days gathering cactus and other plant material to haul home in large burlap sacks. She then dries the moisture from the plants, to produce a natural pigment used to color fabric, yarn, and is even used for hair dye. Julia then sells this pigment to customers who travel 8 hours from Lima to make the purchase, which they know is of a reliable, high quality. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Julia hopes to receive a loan of $500, which she will use to purchase larger quantities of the raw material. She will also use part of the money to help her daughter, who has just started a small business drying animal hides for leather, which will be processed and sold for shoe production. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Julia belongs to a village bank called “Amauta Huamanga” where she friends in the same situation as hers, like Josefa Quispe, who is also a business woman who hopes to receive a US$ 700 loan.

Although she has many children to raise  plus family commitments, she hasn&apos;t failed in taking up these duties. And it’s because of this particular business of ice-blocks where she started from her 1st loan of $750.She is now on her 5th loan of $1500 and it was used to repair the roof of her house and buy more ingredients for her ice-blocks. She has now also added her pancakes business which help the most in her repayments. She believes that without the help she got from the SPBD program through their loans that she could not raise her family and satisfy her family needs as well as her kid’s education.

But they still need financial support in buying agricultural equipment and chemicals to make their garden grow well. That’s why she joined the SPBD program and applied for her 1st loan of $750ST to help out with the business. She said without help and support from South Pacific Business Development, she would not be able to make it. &lt;p&gt;At the moment she is able to sell more of her taro, bananas, and yams at the food market. She is very keen on the program because she believes that without the loan, she is unable to be a better businesswoman.

Two years later, his father died also. Since that time, as the eldest son, he has taken care of his two brothers and other family members. Life has been difficult, so he has worked hard to make ends meet. He has gained strength from my church and have given much time and energy to doing good work in his community on its behalf.&#13;&#10;He wishes to buy his car and to stop renting other people’s cars. This will enable him to service his customers constantly without interruption of the car owners needing their car when he is on duty. It will allow him to save more money for my family and future since his profits will be his own. It will also bring more security to him as he won’t rely on the schedule of another to organize his financial and daily life. And it will give him the opportunity to assist the disabled with free transport without stress.&#13;&#10;He hopes that with this loan he will be able to lift his family out of poverty and provide for their future. He also hopes that he will be able to do good work for the disabled and perhaps even some day develop a larger business to purchase a second car and rent it to another driver in need, such as he is now. If you are so good as to invest in his taxi business, your money will help not only me but many others around him.&#13;&#10;George is pictured beside the car that  he hopes to purchase.</en></texts></description><status>deleted</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><image><id>53238</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Taxi</activity><sector>Transportation</sector><use>to purchase a taxi-car and stop renting other people&apos;s cars</use><location><country_code>KE</country_code><country>Kenya</country><town>Nairobi</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.283333 36.816667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>32</partner_id><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>George</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments/><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>15749</id><name>Matlubahon</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Matlubahon is an experienced specialist in sewing dresses. She has a high education as designer of women&apos;s garments. She worked at a school as teacher of handicrafts, but the salary of a teacher is not enough for supporting her family. &lt;p&gt;She rented a premises for her own workshop. Gradually she bought several sewing machines and employed two assistants. Her business consists of purchasing fabric and making dresses, then selling them in the market. The high quality of their dresses has attracted many clients to her workshop. Presently her workshop is one of the best-known workshops in the area. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since 2006 she has been a client of Micro Invest. Her first loan was $100.

This cooker was recently introduced, &#13;&#10;and due to the high demand, the group is targeting to buy a kiln with higher capacity &#13;&#10;than the one currently in use.&#13;&#10;They also need to purchase a vehicle which would enable them a&#13;&#10; quicker and more efficient means of transporting their goods. &#13;&#10;She hopes that not only does the profit gained by investing this loan for the business helps the group but she sees that life should only improve for her and her family after this.</en></texts></description><status>deleted</status><funded_amount>775</funded_amount><image><id>53970</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Crafts</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>To stock up on materials as well as contribute to buying a group lorry</use><location><country_code>KE</country_code><country>Kenya</country><town>Kisumu</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-0.1 34.75</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>32</partner_id><loan_amount>775</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Priscah</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_amount>775</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>775</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments/><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>15756</id><name>Salimbek</name><description><languages type="list"><language>ru</language></languages><texts><ru>Salimbek inherited his profession, being a butcher, from his father, who inherited it from his father.

Her business started 4 years ago, when she first started selling.  At first she helped her mother and then started bringing and selling products herself.  Firuza’s product selection includes rubber summer footwear, that she sells in the summer.  In the winter she sells winter children’s clothing.  Her 2 younger sisters help her.  She reinvests a portion of her profits into her business and spends the rest on family expenditures.  That is her contribution to the family budget.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Firuza has been a client of MicroInvest for a half year and her business has noticeably expanded.  She plans on using her new loan to further expand her business.P.S in the photo you can see her sister,Firuza wants to rent one more place for her sister.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;

D. G. is 51 years old, is married, and has 6 sons.  The sons are of ages 32, 30, 23, 21, 20, and 14 and they all still live with her in the house.  Even though she was not able to finish her studies and attain a high school diploma, she opened her own convenience store from her residence where she serves everybody in the neighborhood, selling goods of prime need. In the store, she works with her husband and the two youngest who go out and sell their goods to those who can’t go to their store.  The eldest sons all work independently.&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;She confronted several hardships along the way since nobody wanted to hire her or give her any loans and so she started from nothing.  She started out by cleaning clothes for families and did some fishing.  In time, she was able to save enough money to start her convenience store. Now she can proudly say that she has been able to refurbish her entire residence as well as proviD. all her children with a stable living.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In addition to all these problems, her location next to the Paraguay River has brought about some hardships.  Floods are sometimes common which not only make her work extra hard, but also limit the clientele that visit her on those days.  &#13;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She requires the loan to be able to expand her business and make a salon for customers to sit down and eat, since she not only prepares food to go, but she also prepares lunches and dinners  seven days a week.  She also wants to buy more merchandise to proviD. a greater variety of goods for her demanding clientele.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>53262</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>Carolina is 40 years old and a single mother of a 17-year-old son. She lives in her mother&apos;s house, which is located 3km from the center of the city of Encarnaicon. Carolina has worked for 12 years as a chef, earning a fixed salary, at a prominent hotel situated 200 meters from her residence. She was the only source of income in her family (her mother could not work due to her age and her son was a minor). However, Carolina was able to save, and 8 years ago, she opened a grocery store in her home. Her mother and her son help her. She sells all types of common products, like sugar, olive oil, milk products, beverages, and ready-made foods, which she prepares herself. &lt;p&gt; Her biggest concern has always been her son&apos;s education. Thankfully, her effort and dedication has helped her pay for the education of her son, who, in the coming year, will eventually attend the university. Since the cost of his studies will only continue to increase, Carolina hopes to advance her business so that she can obtain greater profits. For her to be able increase her sales, she must increase her stock. For this, she asks for a loan of 275 dollars to purchase products like sugar, olive oil, canned goods, and sweets in bulk. &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Carolina tiene 40 años de edad, es madre soltera de  un hijo varón de 17 años, vive en la casa de su madre, que se encuentra ubicado en un barrio distante, a 3 Km. del centro de la ciudad de  Encarnación. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Carolina trabaja hace ya 12 años en un hotel importante que se encuentra a 2 cuadras (200 mts) de su domicilio, como encargada de cocina, en donde posee un salario fijo, como ella era la única fuente de ingreso en la familia, (ya que su madre ya no podía trabajar por su avanzada edad y su hijo que era aún menor), Carolina pudo ahorrar y abrió hace 8 años, una despensa en su casa, donde la ayudan su madre y su hijo. En su despensa vende todo tipo de productos de primera necesidad como azúcar, aceite, productos lácteos, fideos, bebidas así como también comidas rápidas que ella misma elabora.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Su mayor preocupación siempre fue la educación de su hijo, gracias a su esfuerzo y dedicación ha logrado pagar los estudios de su hijo que el próximo año ya podrá cursar el probatorio para la Universidad. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;En vista de que los gastos del estudio de su hijo van aumentando, ella desea ir progresando y ampliando su negocio para obtener mayores ganancias;  para ello tiene pensado aumentar sus ventas aumentando su stock de mercaderías, por lo que solicita un crédito de $ 275 que lo invertirá en la compra al por mayor de azúcar, aceite, productos enlatados y golosinas.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>53269</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

With this first loan, she will expand the inventory of her store to better meet the needs of her customers.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Note: Edilene is one of five microentrepreneurs in her Bank of Hope solidarity group, all of whom have gone through Esperanza&apos;s business training courses. Each of the five members will receive a share of this $750 loan for their respective businesses and will be accountable to each other for repaying their share of this loan together. This group-lending methodology ensures that members cooperate to help one another repay their loans and invest wisely in their businesses and families.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>53282</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery Store</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Expand her inventory of food products, such as rice and sugar.</use><location><country_code>HT</country_code><country>Haiti</country><town>Trou-du-Nord</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>19.633333 -72.016667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>44</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-10T07:05:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>750</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Edilene</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-08-24T17:21:20Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>750</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>750</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-24T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-24T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-24T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-24T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-14T09:24:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-14T10:19:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>54609</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-14T09:24:53Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-14T10:19:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>67380</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-14T10:25:15Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-14T10:19:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>81475</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-14T10:26:56Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-14T10:19:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>97078</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-14T10:15:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-14T10:19:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>115577</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-14T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-14T10:19:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>135219</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-10T17:21:20Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-02-14T10:19:24Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>15773</id><name>Rosalinda Margarita</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>Rosalinda is 21 years old and married with 2 children.

Now, her husband has left her, and she has restarted (over a year ago) the business of cooking specialty fried dishes to order. During the day, in addition to cooking,  she has to take care of her 4 children (fifteen on down to four years old). However, because she lacks help, she must leave the children on their own, at home, when she travels to deliver her orders (every afternoon). Aurelia needs this loan to build her business and save enough money to move out of her current home. She was very upset when we went to her current house, because she doesn’t like to show how humble it is. It is difficult to get to her house; there is a ravine one must cross in order to get there, and the bridge that crosses it is not safe. (This writer, for one, was afraid to cross!) The polluted waters that run under the bridge attest to Aurelia’s desire to move, but she can’t afford anything else. In fact she lives here because she cannot sell it; no one wants to come close to the foul smelling river. The kids are now so used to it, that they can’t smell it any more. Nor do they seem to get sick, despite the multitude of mosquito and other ticks that bite them daily while they sleep.

He started this business with his own capital. Since a young age, he helped his mother in this same business. His wife also helps with the business. She sells phone cards for cellular phones. Justino works every day from 3pm to 10pm. &lt;p&gt;Justino asks for a loan to purchase more phone cards, especially since every day he collects more customers, increasing the demand. His capital is insufficient to satisfy all his customer&apos;s requests. The loan will help him increase his sales. &lt;p&gt; Justino is 34 years old and married to his wife Rosa with 2 children, one is a year old and the other is 3. His 3-year-old daughter is in a school near his home. Justino lives in the house of his mother, who gave him, as an inheritance, part of the upstairs of her home. Little by little he is building with cement the upstairs.

Her husband is an unemployed fisherman like her, but working together with Ivapene in their plantation, and goes fishing when there is a demand for fish. In the mean time, Ivapene’s family are staying in an open house with palm leaves roofing and no flooring. Ivapene explains that with her previous loans, she tried to maintain her taro plantation in a stable condition, and concentrating on her children’s schooling needs.

Facing a lack of jobs and  the need to secure an income, Mario began selling snacks from a table he set up in front of his house.  His home faces a plaza frequented by many people, and his business grew as a result of that traffic.  When his wife became pregnant with their second child this summer, Mario sought to increase their income by selling yuckis, a drink made of crushed ice and flavored syrup, similar to a slushie.  This was very well received in the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mario is requesting a loan in the amount of US $750, to be repaid in 6 months, to purchase a cart to carry his products around to other plazas in the vicinity in order to increase his sales.

Se parte importante en el crecimiento de este negocio y ayuda a quien más lo necesita, muchas gracias.&lt;/p&gt;</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>53357</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Soft Drinks</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To buy a food cart and supplies/inventory</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Guadalupe, Nuevo Leon</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>25.683333 -100.25</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-15T06:05:06Z</posted_date><loan_amount>750</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Mario Alberto</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-08-30T02:36:58Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>750</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>750</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-29T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-29T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-29T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-29T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-16T09:17:17Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-16T10:15:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55203</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-16T09:16:48Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-16T10:15:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>67977</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-16T10:16:31Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-16T10:15:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>82102</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-16T10:16:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-16T10:15:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>97715</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-16T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-16T10:15:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>116283</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-16T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-16T10:15:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>136130</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-16T02:36:58Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-02-16T10:15:55Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>15801</id><name>Adelia</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt; Adelia S. is married and has two children.

R. , 38, has a little store (a tienda) up in the hills above Nebaj. Her house and store are surrounded by cornfields, but her family does not own any land beyond their house. She opened the tienda two years ago when she received her first loan. In her tienda she sells water, juice, bananas, oil, salt, fruits and other staples that her neighbors will stop by and purchase. Because there is not much work for the people in her town, they did not have money to buy her weavings so she turned to operating a tienda as a continuing source of income.&#13;&#10;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#13;&#10;Maria is married and has 7 children. The youngest two school-age children have not started school yet because she does not have the money for clothes and school supplies. She herself never attended school and therefore cannot read, write, or do addition. Her older children help her in the tienda when there are sums to be done. Their schooling is already paying off. &#13;&#10;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#13;&#10;Maria does still do some weaving. Her specialty is weaving huipils, a traditional top worn by most women in the village of Nebaj. She can produce one in 15 days and sells in the market for up to US$200. &#13;&#10;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#13;&#10;Even though her husband makes money driving a little three-wheeled taxi (called a tuc-tuc, pronounced Tuuk-Tuuk), her dream is to have enough food daily to feed her family.  A major struggle is buying medicine for when a member of her family is ill which luckily is not often. As they say here, &quot;Gracias a Dios.&quot; Even aspirin and anti-acid medicine are extra expenses that are hard to fit into the family&apos;s limited budget.&#13;&#10;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#13;&#10;Written by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva

R., 37, raises goats. She also has one pig and sells cans of juice in the streets of Nebaj. When she receives this loan, she will take the bus to a fairly distant village to buy as many baby goats as she can– she&apos;s hoping to get several. She will then walk home for many hours with the goats instead of taking the bus because she would  be charged about US$3/each to bring the goats back by bus. She will leave at 3:00 in the morning and will arrive home well after dark.&#13;&#10;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#13;&#10;Juana has been Friendship Bridge for the past 3 years. During a previous loan she had bought chickens to sell when full grown. The chickens all died after a brief illness so she decided to change to goats and pigs. &#13;&#10;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#13;&#10;Her life has been hard and shows in every way possible. She is trying to work her way out of deep poverty she has experienced for all her life.. Both of her parents died in the Guatemalan civil war of the 1980´s and early 1990´s. And she lost most of the use of her right hand, including three fingers, in the war years.&#13;&#10;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#13;&#10;She is married to a husband who works in the corn fields and they have 5 children. Though she is resource poor she is resourceful and looking forward to a brighter future.&#13;&#10;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#13;&#10;Written by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva

She can spend as much as a month weaving one, and then can sell it for about US$180, making a profit of about US$140. With this loan she will buy yarn for her weaving, as she has in four years of successful loans with the microfinance partner Friendship Bridge. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Elena has six children aged 16 to 27, and four grandchildren. Her fundamental goals in life are just to get her kids established, keep the younger ones in school, and somehow have a little bit of extra cash for food shortfalls and emergencies. Elena and her family do have some land – they work several small plots of corn, and that helps with food for the family.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Maria C. C., 42 years old, weaves traditional Mayan woman’s clothing, including belts called fajas, exquisite tops called huilpiles and head dressings called cintas. One huilpil can take up to two months to make depending on the design, and sells for up to US$200. Some of the designs tell a story of the region and others are unique designs created by the artist.  A hair piece called a cinta  can take up to 15 days to create and can sell for US$35. As with all traditional women&apos;s clothing in the mountains of Guatemala, the special designs signify what village a woman comes from. &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;This loan will be used to buy more yarn for weaving. Before joining Friendship Bridge Maria had no access to credit and it was difficult to make money weaving just because the yarn was so expensive, costing up to US$40 for the yarn to make a huipil.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Maria´s husband died a couple of years ago when he got drunk and drowned in a lake nearby. With a total of seven children, she must now raise the five youngest by herself.   The two teenage daughters who still live at home are also weavers and help support the family. They attend school on the weekends so they can work during the week. All the school age children attend school, something Maria never had the opportunity to do. She never learned to read or write, speaks just a little bit of Spanish, and signs her name with a thumbprint impression.  Her native language is Ixil. &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Maria&apos;s adobe home has a dirt floor and has electricity and water but the water must be boiled before consuming.

He and his wife sell personal care products.  These include shampoo, tooth paste, hair coloring, products to take care of the body and many other things.  Demand for these types of products is high and brings steady profits.  In addition to selling his products at the markets, Zafar sells his products from home where he has a small store.  Recently his business had a hard period, when the tax authorities demanded that he get a special license to sell self-care products.  The costs of such a license are too high and would not have allowed Zafar to earn a profit.  This type of license is used for wholesale dealers.  Today, the issue has been resolved and the special license is not necessary.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;A year ago Zafar received a loan from MicroInvest and included more expensive shampoos and soaps in his inventory.  This attracted many customers and increased profits.  He purchases his products by traveling to wholesale markets and also receives deliveries from wholesale dealers.  Business is going very well and Zafar would like to take out a new loan to purchase additional products.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Zafar’s wife is pictured in the photo.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Зафарчон и его жена продают парфюмерную продукцию. Она включает в себя шампуни, зубные пасты, краску для волос, средства ухода за телом и многое другое. Спрос на такую продукцию высокий и приносит стабильную прибыль. Кроме базаров Зафарчон продает свои товары и из дому, где у него оборудован маленький магазинчик. Недавно для его бизнеса настал тяжелый момент, когда со стороны налоговых органов потребовали получения специального разрешения на продажу парфюмерной продукции. Стоимость такого разрешения слишком высокая и не позволила бы получать прибыль. Такое разрешение применяется для оптовых продавцов. Сейчас проблема решена и специального разрешения не требуется. Год назад Зафарчон получил займ в Микроинвест и включил в ассортимент более дорогие шампуни и мыло. Это привлекло много клиентов и повысило прибыльность его бизнеса. За товаром он ездит на оптовые рынки и еще ему привозят товары поставщики различных оптовых продавцов. Сейчас очень хорошая торговля и Зафарчон планирует получить новый займ. На фотографии жена Зафарчона.   &#13;&#10;P.S. Зафарчону 29 лет и у него 2 детей.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>53373</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to

Her husband passed away and left her with 7 children.  In addition to her there are 16 other members of her family that live together: 2 sons with their families and 4 non-adult daughters.  The oldest daughter recently got married and lives with her husband.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sources of income need to be found to feed such a large quantity of people.  The two sons drive people in vans on local routes, while Salomat sells traditional Tajik flatbread at the market.  She has been doing this for several years.  Early in the morning one of her sons drives the flatbread to the market, helps her to arrange it on the counter and then leaves for his job.  One of the daughters helps Salomat to sell.  Salomat has many regular clients and she sells all of her flatbread in 3 hours.  5 months ago the price of flatbread increased slightly and Salomat decided to get a loan from MicroInvest.  The loan brought additional profits and since then she has been borrowing continuously.  She plans to use the new loan to further expand her business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Саломат 48 лет. Так получилось что ее муж умер и оставил на нее 7 детей. А живут у нее в семье кроме нее самой еще 16 человек. Это 2 сыновей со своими семьями и 4 ее несовершеннолетних дочери. Старшая дочь недавно вышла замуж и живет со своим мужем. Чтобы прокормить такое количество приходится находить способы зарабатывания денег. 2 ее сыновей возят на микроавтобусах людей по местным маршрутам, а Саломат выходит на базар торговать лепешками (национальный таджикский хлеб). Она занимается этим уже несколько лет. Рано утром один из ее сыновей подвозит лепешки на базар, помогает разложить его на прилавке и затем уезжает на маршрут. Одна из дочерей помогает Саломат торговать. У нее много постоянных клиентов и уже через 3 часа она продает все  лепешки. 5 месяцев назад цена на лепешки немного повысилась, и Саломат решила взять займ в Микроинвест. Полученный займ принес дополнительную прибыль Саломат и с тех пор она постоянно кредитуется. Новый займ планирует потратить на дальнейшее расширение бизнеса.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>53374</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to

Dilbar sells socks and various small goods and her husband sells spare auto parts.  She is 33 years old and has 3 small children.  Her business experience of around 6 years is relatively large.  Dilbar started in business by selling children’s clothing, but soon transitioned to selling small goods (men’s and women’s socks, handkerchiefs, etc.) since this brings higher profits and there is no leftover inventory.  Dilbar’s mother-in-law watches her children so that Dilbar can work at the market.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Dilbar has been borrowing money from MicroInvest for 2 years.

Начинала Дилбар бизнес с торговли детскими вещами, но вскоре перешла на торговлю мелочевкой (носки мужские и женские, платки носовые и т.п.), так как прибыли остается больше и не остается остатков непроданного. Чтобы Дилбар могла спокойно торговать на базаре ее теща следит за детьми дома. Опыт кредитования в Микроинвест составляет 2 года, когда она получила свой первый займ. Начинала с суммы займа в $100.

Boltaboi is 60 years old and his wife is 56 years old, they have 4 children.  Boltaboi and his wife have been selling at the markets for several years.  They sell onions, potatoes and carrots.  These products are in high demand as they are a necessity.  Boltaboi brings the products and his wife sells them.  During one market day Boltaboi sells up to 150 kilograms of potatoes, and 200 kilograms each of onions and carrots.  Profits are small, but they have no other source of income.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Boltaboi is a recent client of MicroInvest, but he has already shown himself to be an exemplary client.  He plans to use the requested loan to purchase potatoes and onions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Болтабой и его жена уже давно на пенсии, но они не могут сидеть без дела дома. Ему 60 лет, его жене 56  лет. У них 4 детей. Уже несколько лет Болтабой и его жена выходят торговать на базары. Ассортимент товаров – лук, картошка и морковь. Спрос на них высокий, ведь это продукты первой необходимости. Товар привозит он сам а жена торгует. За один базар Болтабой продает до 150 кг, картошки, по 200 кг. лука и моркови. Прибыль небольшая, но другого дохода нет. В Микроинвест Болтабой кредитуется недавно, но уже показал  себя как образцовый клиент. Новый займ собирается потратить на закупку картошки и лука.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>53407</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to

Ricarda /joc</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Angela Maria R. and her sister, Ricarda, were born in the town of Nagua, about 80 miles north of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. They ran a beauty parlor there for several months before relocating to Santo Domingo with their families. Their shop has been in its new location for 8 months and is doing very well. Angela Maria has four children and Ricarda has one child (seen here in photo). They all live together in the same house with their mother, and the salon is located in an extension of the house.  Even though the shop is small, they can work on at least two customers at the same time. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Angela and Ricarda have applied for a loan in part to buy a small power generator so that their shop can continue to operate during the eight to ten hours a day when the electricity is out in their neighborhood.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;They are also interested in opening up a new business with their partner, Jocelyn B., to sell natural and herbal remedies produced by a company called Natura International. To make this possible, Angela and Ricarda have applied for loans of $350 each, and Jocelyn for a loan of $200, for a total of $900.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Sale of natural and herbal remedies is a recent development in this area, but  the activity sounds very promising. Until this business has proved itself, however, securing loans will be difficult. But we believe the fact that these three women are working together to make it happen is a good sign that bodes well for repayment of the loan. Also, the beauty parlor is profitable and can help them withstand early losses from the newer herbal business. That&apos;s one reason why, for purposes of this loan, we are considering these women as part of one team.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>53393</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Natural Medicines</activity><sector>Health</sector><use>Emergency power plant and sales of  herbal medicine.</use><location><country_code>DO</country_code><country>Dominican Republic</country><town>Juanita Community of Santo Domingo</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>19 -70.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>66</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-11T00:55:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>900</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Angela, Ricarda /joc</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-08-25T17:54:31Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>900</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>900</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-25T09:21:41Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>58566</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-25T09:26:25Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>71879</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-25T10:30:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>86577</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-25T10:20:57Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>102692</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-25T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>121654</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-25T10:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>142035</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-11T17:54:31Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-02-25T10:07:16Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>15815</id><name>Hai</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mrs. Hai H., 32 years old, lives in Kampong Cham and earns a living selling fish and raising pigs.

Her father left soon after she was born, and her mother abandoned her when she was one year old to flee to Panama.  Nidia has hoped to meet her mother for as long as she can remember, and prays that she will not leave earth without first doing this.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10; There are two ways in which Nidia can achieve this dream. The first is from a local television progam, which is holding out the hope that it may sponsor a trip. The second is by raising the money on her own, although this will mean that she and her husband, Jose, may not be able to have children for a while. But Nidia and Jose are willing to put this off so she can realize her dream of meeting her mother.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In the past, Nidia operated her own beauty salon, but today has worked out an arrangement with a business partner who puts up all the capital in exchange for her doing all the work. Nidia would like to go back to operating her own salon because that would allow her to keep everything she earns, and also because she believes that her partner is not very knowledgable about the business they are in. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Nidia has requested a loan of $350, which will permit her to open her own business, using equipment she has at home. This will allow her to fulfill her dream of being self-employed, and also give her the opportunity to raise enough money to one day meet her mother in person.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>53398</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Beauty Salon</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Business set up</use><location><country_code>DO</country_code><country>Dominican Republic</country><town>Juanita Community of Santo Domingo</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>19 -70.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>66</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-11T00:55:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Nidia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-08-25T13:48:14Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>350</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>59</amount><local_amount>59</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-25T09:21:44Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>59</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>58567</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>59</amount><local_amount>59</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-25T09:26:29Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>59</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>71880</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>59</amount><local_amount>59</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-25T10:30:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>59</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>86578</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>59</amount><local_amount>59</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-25T10:20:58Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>59</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>102693</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>59</amount><local_amount>59</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-25T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>59</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>121655</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>55</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-25T10:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-25T10:07:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>55</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>142036</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-11T13:48:14Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-02-25T10:07:17Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>15818</id><name>Mich</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mrs. Mich T., 48 years old, lives in Kampong Cham and sells vegetable and fruit for a living.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Ivan is married and has a daughter who is seven years old. Two years ago, he left his job to go into business as a self-employed taxi driver because he wanted a stable daily salary. The move has paid off. Currently he makes around $30-$40 a day in gross profit, and even after expenses he is still able to earn a good income. Ivan is working to pay off the loan on his car, and has partnered with a taxi-dispatching company which provides him with a steady supply of good customers.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ivan has requested a loan of $500 to help purchase a license to operate his taxi, which he needs to continue driving, and to repair his cab&apos;s meter. This is the second loan Ivan has requested from Nadiya Ukraine. We are confident that he will continue to be a great client and repay this loan on time.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>53424</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Taxi</activity><sector>Transportation</sector><use>Purchase a taxi license and repair his taxi</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Ivano-Frankivsk</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>48.884167 24.686111</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-14T06:40:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ivan</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-08-28T18:28:10Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-15T09:17:18Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-15T10:17:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>54878</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-15T09:17:05Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-15T10:17:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>67640</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-15T10:17:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-15T10:17:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>81772</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-15T10:17:26Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-15T10:17:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>97358</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-15T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-15T10:17:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>115924</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-15T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-15T10:17:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>135620</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-14T18:28:10Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-02-15T10:17:01Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>15841</id><name>Mariya</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mariya is a widow who lives in Mukachevo, a small city in the western Ukraine.

Eventually, he expanded the business and added new services, such as connecting to mobile operators and increasing the balance on special cards that are used to add money to the account. Because of the technologies involved, this business requires capital investments. In addition, the business employs two people that receive salaries. With his first microcredit from MicroInvest, Abdusamad purchased a fax machine, a scanner, and cards to add money to the account. Currently, he is planning to purchase a new computer and is, therefore, asking for a new microcredit loan.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Абдусамаду 32 года, он женат и у него 1 ребенок. Абдусамад начинал свой бизнес 5 лет назад с предоставления компьютерных услуг населению. Постепенно расширяясь, он включил дополнительно дилерские услуги по подключению к сотовым операторам и пополнению баланса. Бизнес капиталоемкий и требует денежных вложений. Также у него работают 2 сотрудника, которым он платит заработную плату.  Получив займ в Микроинвест, Абдусамад приобрел ксерокс и сканер «два в одном» и карточки пополнения счета. Сейчас он собирается приобрести новый компьютер и для этого просит новый займ.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>53432</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Computers</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>to

Mr. Romel works for a security business in our city and his wife is a housewife.  The family currently occupies a room borrowed from his parents that can be uncomfortable.  &#13;&#10;The requested loan will be used to construct a room in the rear of the home that will be more comfortable and will be the start of future loans that will allow them to build a small, seperate home.  &#13;&#10;This is their first request for a loan and the socioeconomic analysis conducted favorably qualifies them and allows them to achieve greater credit worthiness.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Christian Garcia by Christian Garcia, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;El señor Romer Alarcón vive en casa de sus padres en la zona de Pasankeri ladera oeste de la Ciudad de La Paz con su esposa y sus hijos de 3 y 1 año de edad; el señor Romel trabaja como empleado en una empresa de seguridad de nuestra ciudad y su esposa es ama de casa. Actualmente  ocupan una habitación cedida por sus padres que ocasionan cierta  incomodidad a la pareja como a sus progenitores.&#13;&#10;El crédito solicitado será destinado a la construcción completa de una habitación en la parte posterior de la vivienda que les dará mayor comodidad y será el inicio para con futuros créditos puedan edificar una pequeña vivienda independiente. &#13;&#10;Esta es la

She supports her four young children through her local community food business.  Although Janelia only has the equivalent of an elementary school education, she has proven to be very resourceful in meeting the needs of her customers by providing a mobile delivery service. Since she lacks a physical storefront, Janelia is often seen walking the streets of her community, faithfully delivering her customers&apos; orders to their homes.  She will use this first loan to expand the inventory of her store with foods such as rice and nuts.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Note: Janelia is one of five microentrepreneurs in her Bank of Hope solidarity group, all of whom have gone through Esperanza&apos;s business training courses. Each of the five members will receive a share of this $750 loan for his or her respective businesses and will be accountable to each other for repaying his or her share of this loan together. This group-lending methodology ensures that members cooperate to help one another repay their loans and invest wisely in their businesses and families.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>53467</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery Store</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Expand her inventory with rice and nuts.</use><location><country_code>HT</country_code><country>Haiti</country><town>Trou-du-Nord</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>19.633333 -72.016667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>44</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-14T21:20:05Z</posted_date><loan_amount>750</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Janelia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-08-29T04:32:39Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>750</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>750</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-08T10:25:44Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:05:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>78384</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-08T10:26:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:05:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>93636</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-08T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:05:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>111913</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-08T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:05:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>131157</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-03-08T10:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:05:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>152865</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-04-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:05:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>176963</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-15T04:32:39Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-04-08T09:05:58Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>15863</id><name>Tina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mrs. Tina O. will buy more provisions and food stuff with her next loan.

Next year she&apos;ll be sent to a remote village to teach kids who are getting and education and thus their first chance to break the cycle of poverty here in the Guatemalan mountains.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Rosa&apos;s business is weaving – she weaves the traditional women&apos;s top called a huipil and also several other items of traditional women&apos;s dress. A huipil takes her about two months to weave and will fetch about US$65 in the local market. With this loan, as she has for the last two years, she&apos;ll invest in yarn for her weaving.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Rosa lives with her mom in a two-room block house with a good roof. Her two older brothers send money to help with their living expenses, including Rosa&apos;s tuition, which has been more than US$12/month for many years. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Written by Nancy

B. weaves traditional Mayan shawls to sell in the Nebaj market.

The multi-colored wrap will take 3 days to make and she can sell it for one hundred quetzals  (13 US dollars). The large ones she makes are for the women to carry babies on their backs.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In her 40 years Maria has had incredible struggles. She was the only one in her family who survived the Guatemalan civil war in the 1980´s. She was left in orphan when she was 12. Her struggle still continues as an adult. She lives far up a muddy path amongst the cornfields above  Nebaj. The place she lives is made of miscellaneous  pieces of wood and is danger of collapsing in the next major storm. The floors are dirt  and she has no doors or windows, no electricity, and the water spigot is up the hill. She does not consider this a house and she would very much like to have a house.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her husband works in the cornfields and together they have 4 children. The two oldest are in school and the two younger are not yet of school age. Maria did attend school for a couple years when she was young and learned to read and write, but just barely.  Her big goal in life is to make sure her children get a good education so they do not have to struggle as she has. With an education perhaps they will have more opportunities to break out of the great poverty she has known for too many years. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With this loan she will buy yarn for her weaving, two pigs, and eight  turkeys, all which she will sell in the local market.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Written by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Rosemarie S., a 38-year-old business owner in Trou-du-Nord, Haiti, has overcome the limitation of her illiteracy by operating a meal preparation business.  Left single after a previous marriage, Rosemarie supports herself by providing cooked meals -- often comprised of plantains, rice, and locally grown vegetables -- to her community.  Her business is adjacent to the main bridge entering town, a prime location in Trou-du-Nord for a business such as hers.  Rosemarie will use this first loan to expand her inventory of food and supplies to better meet the needs of her community. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Note: Rosemarie is one of five microentrepreneurs in his Bank of Hope solidarity group, all of whom have gone through Esperanza&apos;s business training courses. Each of the five members will receive a share of this $750 loan for his/her respective businesses and will be accountable to each other for repaying his/her share of this loan together. This group-lending methodology ensures that members cooperate to help one another repay their loans and invest wisely in their businesses and families.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>53506</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Increase her inventory of supplies and food.</use><location><country_code>HT</country_code><country>Haiti</country><town>Trou-du-Nord</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>19.633333 -72.016667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>44</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-14T21:20:05Z</posted_date><loan_amount>750</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Rosemarie</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-08-29T06:56:24Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>750</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>750</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>125</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-08T10:26:04Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:06:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>78390</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-08T10:27:05Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:06:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>93642</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-08T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:06:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>111919</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-08T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:06:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>131163</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-03-08T10:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:06:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>152871</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2008-04-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-04-08T09:06:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>176969</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-15T06:56:24Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-04-08T09:06:05Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>15883</id><name>Epifania</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>Epifania, 56, is married with 8 children.

She purchases and re-sells dried fruit, namely apricots. She purchases apricots that are of low quality, takes them home, sorts through them, and then takes the good fruits to the market. She gains profit from the difference in the sales price. Her older daughter helps her at the market. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Matluba is married, she is 43 years old, and she has 5 children. Her husband does not have a job, and sometimes he comes to help her in the market. Matluba must cover all of her family&apos;s expenses. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She has been partnering with MicroInvest for the past 2.5 years. She started with a $300 loan and eventually raised the sum to $900. August is the time when dried fruits sell cheaply, and Matluba would like to receive a loan to purchase apricots.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#13;&#10;Матлуба занимается предпринимательством уже несколько лет. Она занимается куплей продажей сухофруктов, а именно абрикосов. Она покупает низкосортные абрикосы, привозит домой и отсортировав выносит на базар. Полученная разница в цене и есть ее прибыль. На базаре ей помогает ее старшая дочь. Матлуба замужем, ей 43 года и у нее 5 детей. Ее муж нигде не работает, иногда он выходит помочь Матлубе на базаре. Вся тяжесть семейных расходов лежит на Матлубе. С Микроинвест она сотрудничает уже 2,5 года. Начинала кредитоваться с  $300, постепенно увеличила сумму до $900. В августе наступает пора когда сухофрукты падают в цене и Матлуба хочет получить займ для закупки абрикосов.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1100</funded_amount><paid_amount>1100</paid_amount><image><id>53552</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to

Rajabhon and her elderly mother live with the brother&apos;s family. Her brother has a large family, and to not be a burden on him, Rajabhon trades on the market. She has 8 years of experience purchasing dried fruit on one market, sorting through it, and then reselling quality fruit on another market.  Her mother helps her. The financial gain is small, but it helps to cover the costs. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Rajabhon received her first microcredit loan from MicroInvest 2 years ago; she used the money to purchase fresh apricots and dry them with the help of her family. Since then, she has been receiving loans from MicroInvest.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In August, the price for dried fruit is low, and Rajabhon would like to receive a new loan to purchase and store dried fruit. In January and February, when the prices rise, Rajabhon will be able to receive good profit from her sales.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &#13;&#10;Рачабхон незамужем, ей 46 лет и у нее нет детей.

Так получилось что не найдя нормальной постоянной работы Шоира стала выходить на базар торговать. Шоира разведена с мужем и воспитывает 2 маленьких детей. В этом году ей исполнилось 30 лет. Шоира продает мужскую обувь, и каждый день с утра она ездит по базарам проходящим по кишлакам. Полученные займы Микроинвест помогли ей расширить количество и ассортимент ее товаров. Очередной займ Шоира собирается потратить на закупку осеннего ассортимента мужской обуви.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>53564</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>For

type="list"><language>ru</language></languages><texts><ru>Shafoat buys and resells apricot pits. In Isfar, there is a tradition to crush the pits and take out the soft core called &lt;i&gt;magz&lt;/i&gt;. A lot of local entrepreneurs involved in &lt;i&gt;magz&lt;/i&gt; trade. Shafoat buys &lt;i&gt;magz&lt;/i&gt; at the nearby markets and then resells it at the central market. Shafoat, 42 has 2 children. Her husband works as a collective farmer. His salary is very small, so he helps Shafoat to sell. The workday starts early in the morning and ends at the lunch time. When the trading day is over, Shafoat and her husband transfer the remaining &lt;i&gt;magz&lt;/i&gt; home and sort it there to increase its price. Recently, Shafoat received a loan from MicroInvest and increased the volume of &lt;i&gt;magz&lt;/i&gt; that she sells. Shafoat plans to use this loan to further expand her business.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Шафоат занимается куплей продажей абрикосовых косточек. В Исфаре принято раскалывать косточки, и извлеченное ядро называется «магз». Куплей продажей «магз»-а занимается много предпринимателей. Шафоат закупает «магз» по окрестным базарам и продает на центральном рынке. Шафоат 42 года, у нее 2 детей. Ее муж работает простым колхозником. Заработная плата маленькая и он тоже выходит на базар и помогает своей жене. Рабочий день начинается рано утром и продолжается до обеденного времени. После окончания базара Шафоат и ее муж перевозят оставшийся «магз»  домой и далее сортируют. Это дополнительно увеличивает цену. Недавно Шафоат получила займ в Микроинвест и увеличила количество «магз»-а. Очередной займ она собирается потратить на дальнейшее расширение своего бизнеса.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>53574</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Business

She is raising a daughter. Malica, 46 has high school education. Malica sells women’s shoes. Her daughter sells in a small store at the central market, while Malica travels to sell on the markets nearby. Two years ago, when Malica received her first loan to expand her business, she did not own the store. Gradually growing the business, Malica opened the small store. Today, Malica continues to collaborate with MicroInvest. She asks for another loan to continue expansion of her business.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Малика незамужем и воспитывает дочь. Ей 46 лет, образование среднее. Занимается Малика продажей женской обуви. На центральном рынке у Малики есть маленький магазин, где торгует ее дочь, а она сама ездит торговать по окрестным рынкам. 2 года назад она получила свой первый займ для расширения бизнеса. Тогда у нее еще не было магазина. Постепенно расширяя свой бизнес Малика смогла открыть магазин. Малика и сейчас активно сотрудничает с Микроинвест и просит займ для дальнейшего развития своего бизнеса.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>53584</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe

Over this time, big changes happened in her life. In the past, Munira had no house of her own. Since she started her business, by putting aside a fraction of the profits, Munira was able to buy a parcel of land and begin a house construction. Munira, 35 is married and has 3 children. Her husband has no permanent job and puts all his efforts to help her wife in her challenging business. Munira buys dried apricots and pit. She and her family then sort the purchases and re-sell them based on the sorted grades. With help of MicroInvest loans, Munira significantly increased the asset value of her business. Following Munira’s advice, many other women, who sell dried fruits, became MicroInvest borrowers. Now, Munira asks for a new loan to purchase dried fruits.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Более 2 лет Мунира является клиентом Микроинвест. За это время в ее жизни произошли большие изменения. Раньше у нее не было своего собственного дома. Занимаясь бизнесом и откладывая прибыль она смогла купить участок земли и начала постройку дома. Мунире 35 лет, она замужем и у нее 3 детей. У ее мужа нету постоянной работы и он всеми силами старается помочь своей жене в ее нелегком бизнесе. Мунира покупает сушеный абрикос и его косточки, она и ее семья сортируют купленное и затем продают по сортам. С помощью займов Микроинвест Мунира значительно увеличила активы своего бизнеса, следуя ее совету, многие женщины, торгующие сухофруктами, пришли в Микроинвест и получили займы. Сейчас она просит новый займ для закупки сухофруктов.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>53588</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to

He sends some money, but the transfers are catastrophically low to pay for his family’s necessities, while life is getting more expansive every day. To make ends meet, Matluba sells clothing for children and light fabrics at nearby markets. Matluba, 30 is a mother of 2 children. Her business pays for most of her family expanses. A year ago, Matluba heard of MicroInvest and came for her first loan. According to her, the loan gave her business a boost and brought additional income. A season of strong sales is approaching and Matluba wants to receive a new loan to buy school uniforms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Муж Матлубы как и многие мужчины ее региона находится на заработках в России. Он присылает деньги для содержания семьи, но их катастрофически не хватает, тем более жизнь дорожает с каждым днем. Матлуба занимается предпринимательством и продает детскую одежду и легкие ткани. Торгует она по окрестным базарам. Матлубе 30 лет и у нее 2 детей. За счет бизнеса она покрывает большую часть своих семейных расходов. Услышав и Микроинвест она пришла и получила первый займ год назад. По ее словам это дало толчок для развития бизнеса и дало дополнительную прибыль. Скоро наступает сезон хорошей торговли  и она хочет получить новый займ для закупки школьной одежды.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>53601</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To

She has been selling on a market for 6 years. The goods that she sells include clothing for children, socks for men and women, and other small items. Munjot’s children are small and Munjot’s mother-in-law takes care of them. Munjot buys and delivers her goods from a wholesaler in Istaravshan. Munjot does not have a permanent trading spot, so she has to sell wherever she can find a place. Her husband sends money from Russia, where he works as a seasonal laborer. Munjot became a MicroInvest borrower a year and a half ago. Then, her business assets were about $450. By now, Munjot more than doubled the value of her business. Munjot hopes to use the new loan to continue expansion of her business.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Муночот 35 лет, она замужем и у нее 3 детей. В течении 6 лет она выходит на базар торговать. Ассортимент ее товаров составляет детская одежда, мужские и женские носки и другая мелочевка. Дети Муночот маленькие и за ними следит дома ее теща. За товаром Муночот ездит на оптовый рынок в г. Истаравшан. У нее нет постоянного места для торговли и она торгует где придется.  Ее муж  находится в России и присылает деньги. В Микроинвест она начала кредитоваться 1,5 года назад. Тогда объем ее бизнеса составлял примерно $450. Сейчас он увеличился более чем в 2 раза. Новый займ она собирается потратить на увеличение объема продаваемых товаров.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>53608</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Business

They have been doing this for 4 years. They have no other permanent jobs and their business is the only source of income. Mahbuba and her husband travel among all markets in the region, so they have to work every day of the week. Selling at a single market brings them $150-200 in earnings. Mahbuba became a MicroInvest client 6 months ago. Now, she plans to take another loan to increase the volume of goods sold. The Juraevs are on the photo.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Махбуба и ее муж занимаются изготовлением и продажей шашлыка. Опыт в этой деятельности 4 года. Постоянной работы нету и бизнес является основным источником семейного дохода. Для их бизнеса каждый день является рабочим, так как они посещают все базары региона.

She joined Pro Mujer approximately a year and a half ago.&lt;p&gt;She used to work as an assistant in various beauty salons on the Avenida 16 de Julio, dreaming of the day when she would be able to have her own business.&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, thanks to the help of a relative, Selma succeeded in opening her own beauty salon, very modest and with barely the space necessary. Thanks to her first loan, she was able to buy hair color, creams and other products she needs for her work. &lt;p&gt;At the moment Selma needs capital to be able to expand her business. Thanks to her good work, demand for her services is outpacing her capacity to provide them. For this reason, she would like to buy a stylist&apos;s table and more materials to be able to hire employees and establish herself in the industry, thereby improving her quality of her life and that of her family.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pertenece a la Asociación Comunal Estrellas de Mar del Centro Focal de Villa Adela, de profesión estilista, Selma R. es madre de 2 hijos en edad escolar.

Posteriormente se dedico a la confección artesanal de mantas de vicuña, pero la fragilidad de su salud no le permitió seguir, ya que los dolores de espalda y algunas dolencias pulmonares, la obligaron a cambiar de rubro y aprender autodidácticamente el arte de la repostería.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Actualmente Cristina necesita de capital para poder comprar un horno industrial que le permita

By her sister&apos;s advice she decided to start her own business in addition to her job. She travels to pick up the goods that her sister sells for her. The assortment of goods includes women&apos;s clothing and foot wear. Habiba has been an active Mikroinvest client since 2005. Her business has grown to  twice it&apos;s original size. She purchases the goods not only from the local wholesale stores, but directly from the city of Alma Ata&apos;s wholesale dealers. Because of this she makes more profits. Currently Habiba has no permanent trading place, that is why she is applying for a loan to expand her business and use the profits towards rent. The picture shows Habiba&apos;s sister. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Elena Sheyner, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Хабиба работает на государственной службе. Дополнительно к этому она, посоветовавшись с сестрой, решила начать заниматься бизнесом. Хабиба ездит за товаром, а сестра торгует. Хабибе 39 лет.  Ассортимент товаров составляет женская одежда и обувь. В Микроинвест Хабиба кредитуется с 2005 года. За это время обороты ее бизнеса возросли вдвое. Кроме местных оптовых рынков она стала приобретать товар для реализации у оптовиков привозящих товар из Алма-Аты. Это приносит дополнительную прибыль. В данный момент у нее нет постоянного места для торговли, и поэтому Хабиба хочет получить займ для расширения бизнеса, чтобы прибыль, полученная от бизнеса, позволила в будущем арендовать торговое место. &#13;&#10;На фото Вы видите сестру Хабибы.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>53763</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

both attend school; they all live in their own house, located in the San Pedro neighborhood, with all the basic amenities, a few minutes from the center of the city of Encarnación. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ms. María  finished her university studies 10 years ago, as a pharmacist. Her husband is an ex soccer player, who played in several professional teams in Paraguay, but who had to abandon his passion early, as consequence of a serious injury in one of his knees he suffered then. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;María is the owner of two pharmacies, one of which is run by herself and the other by her husband, both located in a strategical point going out of the city. She relates that, with great sacrifice, she saw her business grow and, thanks to that, they are able to provide a dignified life and education to their children. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Thanks to the good profits generated by both pharmacies, they are presently opening another one and, in order to stock it, María is asking for a $400 loan, with which to buy more supplies for the new location. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora María Z. tiene 35 años y está casada con el señor Ramón de 40 años; tienen dos hijos: una nena de 13 años y un varón de 5 años; ambos van a al colegio; viven en  su casa propia, ubicada en el barrio San Pedro, con todas las comodidades básicas y a pocos minutos del centro de la ciudad de Encarnación. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora María culminó sus estudios universitarios hace 10 años, como licenciada en Farmacéutica. Su marido es un ex jugador de fútbol profesional, quién jugó en varios clubes importantes del Paraguay, pero tuvo que abandonar su pasión tempranamente, a consecuencia de una grave lesión que tuvo en aquel entonces en una de sus rodillas. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;María es propietaria de dos farmacias, una de las cuales es atendida por ella y la otra por su esposo, ambas ubicadas en lugares estratégicos saliendo de la ciudad. Ella cuenta que, con mucho sacrificio pudo ver crecer su negocio, y gracias a ello pueden dar una vida y educación digna a sus hijos. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Gracias a las buenas ganancias que le generan ambas farmacias, hoy día están abriendo un local más y para poder abastecer de mercaderías, María, solicita un crédito de $400, con los que podrá comprar más medicamentos para surtir su nuevo

They all live in a house a couple of minutes from the center of the city. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Carmen runs a grocery store at home, where she sells all kinds of basic needs products, such as oil, sugar, noodles, rice, dairy products and bread. With time, her business has grown and she now has a good sized clientele, due to location, as there are not many similar businesses in the area. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Thanks to her profits, she has been able to provide a dignified life to her children and have them study. Since she only finished elementary school, it is her dream that, one day, her children will obtain a college degree. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Carmen is asking for $200, that she’ll invest in the purchase of more merchandise, such as oil, sugar, noodles, rice and soda, the products that are in greater demand among her clients.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;La señora Carmen tiene 51 años de edad, es casada y tiene 6 hijos; su marido tiene una carnicería en el centro de la ciudad hace ya más de 15 años y todos sus hijos estudian en un colegio de la ciudad.

Con los años, su negocio fue ampliándose; ella cuenta con muy buen número de clientes gracias a la buena ubicación, pues la zona no cuenta con muchos negocios del mismo tipo. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Gracias a las buenas ganancias, ella puede dar una vida digna a sus hijos y hacerlos estudiar. Ya que ella solo concluyó sus estudios primarios, ella sueña que sus hijos puedan recibirse en la universidad algún día. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Carmen solicita $200, que invertirá en la compra de más mercaderías para la venta, tales como aceite, azúcar, fideos, arroz, y gaseosas, pues son estos los productos de mayor demanda por sus clientes.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>53842</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

She is placing her hopes very high, intending to send all of her children to the university in the capital city of Santo Domingo, some 45 kms. away from their home.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>53846</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Catering</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase raw ingredients</use><location><country_code>DO</country_code><country>Dominican Republic</country><town>Ciruelillo community of Yamasa</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>19 -70.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>66</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-14T06:40:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Elsida</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-08-28T10:54:46Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>250</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-28T09:19:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-28T10:05:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>59826</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-28T10:21:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-28T10:05:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>73243</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-28T10:22:11Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-28T10:05:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>88089</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-28T10:23:07Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-28T10:05:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>104184</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-28T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-28T10:05:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>123408</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>40</amount><local_amount>40</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-28T10:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-28T10:05:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>40</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>143888</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-14T10:54:46Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-02-28T10:05:30Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>16044</id><name>Julia</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Julia has lived in this house for eight years. She has five kids, one with a former husband. Her present husband has a small shop where he dedicates himself to iron works. When we asked her husband about who helps whom in the family, he stated that it is he who helps her, as her business is smaller than his.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Julia&apos;s business is selling clothing which she normally buys in the capital, Santo Domingo, where there is a secondary market for the Haitian packs (&quot;pacas&quot;) of new and used clothing that are sold in the border towns, which become major  trading markets between Haitians and Dominicans at the beginning and end of the week.  As the majority of the Haitian people are very poor, they get donations in the form of new and used clothing.  They pack these into &quot;pacas&quot; and bring them to the border in order to convert the goods into money they can use to buy food and other necessities.  Their Dominican counterparts take this opportunity to purchase goods at discount prices, so that they can in turn use these low-cost (usually high-quality) products for sale back in their hometowns. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Julia doesn&apos;t have the opportunity to make the long trip (usually a whole day) to the Haitian border. because the trip to Haiti is expensive.  The cost runs anywhere from $25 to $30 in public transportation (roundtrip). However, she needs to take the time and trouble to buy these products if she wishes to make the profit margin which hopefully will more than justify the sacrifice involved.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>53850</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Kennedy Mukunga M. is a soft-spoken, 27-year-old single gentleman. He lives with his parents and two siblings at the Garden estate on Thika Road, Nairobi. Kennedy operates a cyber café, at the Kenyatta Market, Golf Course Centre. He offers Internet services, photocopying, word processing and printing services and even telephone and document-binding services. He has often provided support services to the Action Now Kenya office, as well as to many other companies in the area. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Kennedy went to the Kenya School of Professional Studies where he took courses in IT (Information Technology) from 2001 to 2003. After his studies he got a job at a Video Library located at the Garden estate where he worked for two years. In the year 2005, he was employed at a hardware shop located at Donholm estate, East of Nairobi. He was inspired by his father to set up a cyber café, and with his father&apos;s assistance together with the little savings he had put aside, Kennedy set up the cyber café in April 2006. This has helped him a great deal because it has uplifted his life since then, and unlike many youths of his age in Kenya, he does not have to depend on his parents for his personal expenses.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Kennedy now wishes to expand his business in order to be able to do colour printing, which currently he is not able to do. He is therefore requesting a loan of US$ 250, which will enable him to purchase the colour printer. This will go a long way toward giving his clients quality services which will translate into higher income.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Wainaina N. is a 42-year-old man, married with four children. Apart from his children, N. supports his aged parents and also takes care of HIV infected and affected people in his community by providing foodstuffs to the affected homes on a weekly basis. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Wainaina started his business in March 2007, his dream come true since he had had a passion to start up a kerosene pump business. Wainaina can be described as a very hardworking man. He previously had set up a small dry cleaning business, which was financed by his benefits from a Nairobi transport provider, Kenya Bus Service Company, after he was laid off. This business was operational from 1998 to 2002. Apart from his business, N. is also a community worker within Kayole where he resides. He runs a small community based organization by the name of AIDS Link, and he is sometimes hired by NGOs and social work groups to assist in matters affecting his community. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Through his hard work, and from the payments he received from the transport company, N. managed to save up Ksh 95,000 (US$ 1440), which he used to start off his kerosene-selling business. He has undergone several business management training courses and has gained a lot of experience, both from the dry cleaning business that he used to run and also from the kerosene business that he is currently operating. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;N. wishes to expand his business. His vision for the business is to become able to sell on a wholesale scale in his area. His only difficulty is finances necessary to stock more kerosene, which is the main fuel used for cooking within his community. He is requesting a loan of US$ 800, which will be repayable within 12 months. The loan will enable him to expand his kerosene business and attract more customers, since he will have enough kerosene to meet the needs within his community. This will also enable him to make his prices more reasonable, a great advantage to his customers. The additional stock will also require him to employ 2-3 people from his community, to assist him in serving the customers. The additional loan will enable him to increase his income, hence improve his family’s lifestyle.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>53945</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fuel/Firewood</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Purchase

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Simon Mwaniki is 38 years old and married. He has no children of his own but has two dependants, his aging parents whom Simon entirely supports. Simon Mwaniki lives in Ruai.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Simon was first employed in a lumber-selling business in the year 2000 and worked for three years. During that period, he managed to save Ksh 40,000 (US$ 615). The three-year experience also gave Simon enough confidence to start his own lumber business, which he still has to date, though with some struggles.    &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#9;&#13;&#10;Simon’s business suffered a setback in the year 2006 due to his wedding preparations, which ended up causing him huge unforeseen costs relating to the culture and traditions of his tribe that he was expected to adhere to, if he was to receive their blessings to marry his bride.  Through this time and due to the financial strain that Simon experienced, his business suffered and he still finds it hard to bring it back up again. Simon needs support in order to revive his business again.  He is therefore requesting a loan of US$ 1000, which he will use to purchase lumber to restock his business. He will be very grateful if he can receive this support, in order to improve his business. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Simon believes that once he has additional stock, his customers will be able to purchase enough lumber to meet their needs, especially those who purchase in bulk.  This will save them the inconvenience of having to travel all the way to the city center to buy lumber, at a much bigger cost to them. The loan therefore will enable him to serve his customers efficiently and effectively. He will also earn more income so as to uplift himself and his family. The loan repayment period will be 12 months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>53949</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Timber Sales</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>To purchase lumber for sale</use><location><country_code>KE</country_code><country>Kenya</country><town>Ruai, Nairobi</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>1 38</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>36</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-14T21:20:05Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Simon</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-08-30T00:28:45Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-29T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-29T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-29T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-29T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-03-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-04-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-05-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-06-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.37</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.37</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-21T09:18:33Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-10T15:26:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>70272</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-21T10:19:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-10T15:26:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>84580</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>832</amount><local_amount>832</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-10T15:26:43Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-10T15:26:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>832</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>94818</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-16T00:28:45Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-10T15:26:44Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>16059</id><name>Kung</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mrs. Kung B.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Julius M. is a 33-year-old man, married, with one child. Julius lives at Mlolongo, an informal settlement along the Nairobi – Mombassa highway. Apart from caring for his young family, Julius has the burden of taking care of his brothers and sisters after losing both of his parents.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#9;&#13;&#10;Julius started his restaurant business in the year 2006. This was after he and the other employees he worked with were sent home after the chain of supermarkets they were working for came under receivership. Since Julius had experience in dealing with customers while at the Uchumi supermarket, his former workplace, he decided not to waste his skills. He therefore ventured into the restaurant industry, where he felt that he could make use of his skills while at the same time earning some money for the upkeep of his family and siblings.  &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#9;&#13;&#10;In order to finance the start-up of his business, Julius sold one of his cows for a total of Ksh 18,000 (US$ 300) and put this amount in, together with his personal savings of Ksh 40,000.00 (US$ 670), which he had put aside while still in employment. With this, he opened his business in the year 2006. The business has since been doing very well, and Julius now feels that he wants to improve the business by adding on some kitchen equipment. This will include a cooker, a refrigerator, a French fries warmer, a juice extractor, a blender, and some cooking fat. These will enable him to give his clients quicker and better service. &lt;P&gt;The population within the Mololongo area is rapidly growing and Julius wants his business to grow with the rising number of potential customers. For this reason he is kindly requesting a loan of US$ 1000 so that he can fully equip his restaurant. &lt;P&gt;Given this loan, Julius feels that he will be able to give his customers the very best service. He will also be able to employ 2 young men to assist  him in running the business, thereby benefiting the community by creating employment. The repayment period for this loan will be 8 months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>53954</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Jonah N. Kariuki is a 42-year-old man, married with two children. He lives in Kitengela town in Athi River, in the Eastern Province of Kenya. Jonah started singing while in school. His music teacher noticed his musical talent and nurtured him to the point where he became a seasoned singer by the time he was through with his music lessons.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After school Jonah married Bilha Njeri who also is a gospel singer. Together, in the year 1995, they released their first album by the name of “ Ngai oiga ni oiga” meaning “if God says he has said it”, which consists of 12 songs. This album sold like hotcakes and with the proceeds Jonah was able to rent a shop in Kitengela and buy a generator which up to now he uses to preach the word of God and advertise his cassettes. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jonah has a soft heart for children and has started a children’s home in Ruai town, on the outskirts of Nairobi. The children’s home, Fire Ministry Children’s Home, takes care of 45 orphans. Apart from the orphans at the children’s home, Jonah takes care of his sister and her 2 children because she is sick and unable to take care of them. He also takes care of the 5 orphaned children of his sister-in-law who died of HIV/AIDS in the year 2000.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Well aware of advances in music production used to recorded on CDs and DVDs, Jonah wants to go HI-TECH with his music. Therefore he is requesting a loan of US$1200. Given this loan, he will purchase a keyboard, amplifier, two speakers, and a microphone. With this equipment, he will be in a better position to produce music on CDs and DVDS and through this, he will earn more income. This will enable him to spread the gospel and provide for his very big family. The repayment period for the loan will be 8 months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>53957</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Musical

She runs a shop in Kariakoo, Dar es Salaam’s-and perhaps Tanzania’s- biggest trading area.  She deals in cosmetics, decorations, children&apos;s toys, and stationery. She has been in this business for the past four years and is both a wholesaler and retailer.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She currently faces a lot of competition and as such,&#13;&#10; has decided to attract more customers by increasing the variety of stock for her shop. She is also planning to open up another shop, outside the city center. Joyce recently obtained a loan of  USD 1,000 which she paid back in full. She is now in need of USD 1,200 to help  her buy more stock and expand her

This is the main source of his income. He does this during active construction seasons. In his free time Muhamadali and his wife sell vegetables at a local market. His produce is in big demand and sells quickly. The profits are enough to supplement  the family budget  and provide for the family. Muhamadali is 42 years old and married with 3 children. He purchases vegetables from local farmers at wholesale prices and sells them retail. This year in January he took out a loan from Microinvest and used it to increase his working capital. Currently he wants to take  advantage of low costs of potatoes and onions by using a new loan to purchase these products.&#13;&#10;The picture shows Muhamadali&apos;s wife selling her wares at the market.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Elena Sheyner, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Мухамадали занимается строительством частных домов. Сейчас для его деятельности наступил сезон, и он активно этим занимается. Это его основной доход. В свободное время он и его жена торгуют на рынках овощами. Его продукция пользуется большим спросом и быстро раскупается. Прибыли остается достаточно, чтобы  пополнить семейный бюджет и прокормить семью. Он женат, ему 42 года и у него трое детей. Товар покупает оптом у местных производителей и потом продает. В январе этого года он получил займ в Микроинвест и пополнил свой оборотный капитал. Сейчас цены на лук и картошку минимальные и он хочет получить новый займ для их закупки. &#13;&#10;На фото Вы видите его жену.</ru></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>53998</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to purchase potatoes and onions</use><location><country_code>TJ</country_code><country>Tajikistan</country><town>Kanibadam</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>40.283333 70.416667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>47</partner_id><posted_date>2007-08-26T07:05:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Muhammadali</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-09-09T17:37:09Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>250</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-09T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-09T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-09T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-09T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-03-09T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-26T09:21:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-26T10:04:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>58933</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-26T09:22:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-26T10:04:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>72250</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-26T10:22:25Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-26T10:04:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>86975</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-26T10:17:55Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-26T10:04:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>103046</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-26T10:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-26T10:04:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>122021</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>40</amount><local_amount>40</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-26T10:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-26T10:04:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>40</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>142411</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-08-26T17:37:09Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-02-26T10:04:23Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>16079</id><name>Fri</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Fri is a wife and mother of five children.

This challenge led her to become a GHAPE member in 1999, where she was trained in business management, marketing techniques and credit discipline. Since then, she has obtained and repaid 5 loans. With these loans, she was able to pay for medication for her handicapped daughter and pay school fees for her children. She was also able to feed her children with some of the food she cultivates. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Justina is now requesting a loan of $800 with which she plans to fatten and sell pigs, sell foodstuff and cultivate crops.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>N. Raymonde is 37 years old, a mother of 5 and married to a polygamist. Her toughest challenge has been her past sickness during which she spent all her capital on medication. This forced her to remove her children from school since she could no longer pay their school fees, and her husband was not able to shoulder this responsibility.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her low self esteem, caused by all these set backs, hindered her from looking for help. She states that “thanks to GHAPE women who talked to me and took me to centre meetings, I heard other women&apos;s experiences and realized that I am not alone. This is how I became a member”. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She took her first loan in 2006 and is proud of having successfully invested and repaid this loan with income from her investment. With this loan, she was able to sell foodstuff, fish to her community and provide for some basic needs of her children. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;N. is now requesting a loan of $300 with which she plans to sell smoked fish, which is a welcome soup ingredient in her community. She intends to continue using the proceeds from her business to provide for her children. She plans to repay the loan in 15 months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>54027</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>purchase

Even though he is unmarried and has no children of his own, his late younger brother left behind three children to care for. As an unemployed man, he found it difficult to provide for the children&apos;s basic needs so he sought help from GHAPE and was trained in business skills. He has already received loans up to $1,000 to pay for the children&apos;s education.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He is now requesting a loan of $1,200 with which he will buy and fatten pigs and goats to be sold for meat to restaurants. He plans to repay his loan in 24 months. The first loan repayment installment shall be made on the fourth  month from the date of disbursement of the loan.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>54042</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Purchase piglets, pig feed, goats</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

There they sell all types of products to the community ranging from jewelry to office supplies. Cruz and her sister started off by putting together savings and selling just paper, pens and other school supplies. As they grew, they began to invest in many different products to sell. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Although the business was going well, Cruz’s sister married about a year and a half ago and made the decision to move to a new city. Obviously, this affected Cruz.  She had to make monthly payments to her sister in order to repay for the capital she put up. Instead of having two people invest in the business, Cruz found herself alone and limited by the payments. She used a loan from Kiva and Mifex to help her get past the tough times and this resulted in a great deal of help for her. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Cruz is now seeking this loan in order to invest in completely new products now that she is finished paying her sister. She is confident in her ability to sell and assures lenders that there is sufficient demand to justify an investment. She is happy to be able t provide for her two children.&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>54059</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Zakir lives with his wife and four children in the southern Azerbaijan region near Imishli, in the village of Boshallar. He rented his small petrol station in 1998, repaired the place and opened his business. He and his son work together and over the years they have earned constant customers. Since 2005 the price for petrol in Azerbaijan has increased by 50 percent. To keep his clients he is applying for $1,000 to keep buying the same amount of petrol he was selling before the price increased.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>54104</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fuel/Firewood</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To

He lives in the southern part of Azerbaijan, in the center of the town of Imishli. He started his business 3 years ago. With money he borrowed form his friends he rented a small store and purchased pens, notebooks and markers. In less than one year his business increased and all these goods sold quickly. He enlarged his store and purchased more stationery. Elnur&apos;s store is open from early morning until late at night, and selling is going very well, so he decided to apply for $900 loan to add to his inventory computer

Her source of motivation is from difficulties she has faced, especially poor health which has resulted in a surgical operation on her leg. This further compounded the situation and the consequences include inability to educate her children even in primary school.&#13;&#10;Encouraged by GHAPE borrowers Cecilia became a member of GHAPE and received a loan of $40 in 2003 and since then has proven her ability to receive, invest and repay loans up to the amount of $400. From previous loans she provided her community with fresh food. She is very proud of her achievements especially her success in owning and managing her own business. With profits from these loans, she has been paying children’s school fees. &#13;&#10;Given a loan of $600, Cecilia plans to continue in the same line of business of selling water fufu and Eru and crop cultivation. Water-fufu is made out of fermented cassava. It is palatable with okra and Eru. Eru is green vegetables prepared with smoked fresh  cow skin. When crayfish is added to it and a few magi cubes, even passers-by smell it and saliva is generated. Water fufu and Eru was once a highly appreciated traditional dish in the south west province of Cameroon but today it is widely eaten by most Cameroonians. Her intention is to use the profit to continue to educate her children and take care of her health. Cecilia plans to repay her loan during the loan term.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>54123</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>purchase of foodstuffs, hire labor, buy wood, transport expenses</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Nkwen Market, NW.

Health problems have rendered him not strong enough to cultivate crops which are the main economic activity in his community. As a result, he has resorted to rearing animals and producing honey which is less strenuous in his estimation. Due to inadequate capital, he could not raise enough revenue to meet  the needs of his family. Motivated by other GHAPE members in his community, he joined the program and received loans of $40 and $130 in 2005 and 2006 respectively. The profit he got from the loans was used to pay tuition for his children. Given the high demand of his products, there is need for expansion.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of $200, Emmanuel plans to repair his pig sty, buy more bee hives and feed for his pigs. His community will benefit from this in that there will be more honey, pork, and manure at their disposal for a better standard of living.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He plans to repay the loan during the loan term.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>54127</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rearing of pigs, goats and production of honey</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Mbengwi, NW.

Her father died when she was young and she didn&apos;t have  the opportunity to go to school. That’s why she has made up her mind to give the best of education to her children. Realizing the heavy school needs, she vowed to work very hard and sought assistance from GHAPE. She joined the program in 2004. Since her restaurant is located near a school, there is always a ready market. School children have been benefiting a lot from her activities as they always have something to eat in the morning and during break. Given a loan of $300, Martha plans to buy Koki beans, palm oil, flour, yeast and sugar. She plans to repay the loan during the loan term.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>54132</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Cooking

southern part of Azerbaijan.  Zefer opened his store in 2003, when he was only 24. He recently got married and has 1 child.  Summer temperatures in Imishli reach a sweltering 50C so people do not stay long when they come into the store. &lt;P&gt; Zefer has applied for a loan of US$1200  to purchase and install a new air conditioner and give his customers a chance to enjoy a cool comfortable search for the items they want to purchase. Zefer notes, &quot;Most of the customers who come into my store are women. They like to spend a lot of time searching for cosmetics or perfume and I want to create a comfortable place for them, even in sumertime.&quot;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>54141</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cosmetics
