He will buy starters, crowns, pistons and chains, and this will help him meet the demands of his customers. &lt;p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>225</funded_amount><paid_amount>225</paid_amount><image><id>131807</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Motorcycle Repair</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To buy parts to fix motorcycles.</use><location><country_code>PY</country_code><country>Paraguay</country><town>Caaguazú</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>-22.993333 -57.996389</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>58</partner_id><posted_date>2008-02-26T18:39:41Z</posted_date><loan_amount>225</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Hugo</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-03-11T20:18:31Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PYG</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>225</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-04-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-05-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-06-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>45</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>45</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-03-27T10:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-27T09:09:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>212559.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>167333</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>45</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-04-27T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-27T09:09:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>212559.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>193157</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>45</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-27T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-27T09:09:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>212559.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>220976</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>45</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-06-27T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-27T09:09:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>212559.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>250150</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>45</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-27T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-27T09:09:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>212559.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>278719</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-02-26T21:18:31Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-07-27T09:09:25Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>37634</id><name>Mujeres Trabajadoras Elegantes, Group 1</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Benise M. lives in a small community outside of Puerto Plata on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic. She is originally from Haiti. Her parents came to the Dominican Republic in hopes of finding more opportunities and a better life. Benise is 29 years old and lives with her husband and her child. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Benise has worked hard for many years but has only made enough money to barely provide for her needs. She lives in a Haitian community where unemployment rates and poverty are seen in large percentages. Currently, she sells food to about 40 construction workers a day by walking around and looking for current building projects. Work is very hard for her because she walks around all day and already has problems with one of her knees.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She currently lives with a large group of family members but one day hopes to build her own house. In five years, she hopes to build a home of her own. Benise feels that it is very hard to live in a country and a house that is not her own. She is very appreciative of the opportunity that she is now getting and desperately wants to improve her life. She hopes to give her son a better life and the chance to attend a good school. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of everyone here at Esperanza International, and from Benise herself, we thank

She sells these items in her community, either from her home or by walking up and down the streets showing people her merchandise.

Pancho Mateo is one of the poorest communities in Puerto Plata – it is typical to see cardboard nailed to thin metal sheets serving as houses and the use of thin cloth as doors. In midst of poverty, the people remain full of joy and truly love the people they live with. Dilia and her husband raise two children and life has been very hard for them.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Dilia has chronic stomach problems and experiences severe pain but she can’t afford to buy the proper medicine. She currently has her own business selling clothes, shoes, soap, and lotion. Her goals for the future are to have a proper house with a good roof and floor and to have a larger business that makes more money. She wants to continue sending her children to school and she would also like to buy medicine for

children (ages: 11, 6, 5)  in a small community in Puerto Plata.  She works a lot, but when she is not working she loves watching tv and drinking soda. This is her second loan. With her first loan she set up a small juice stand in her community. She sells several different types of juice including passion fruit, orange, pineapple, and apple.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Dilcia&apos;s first loan allowed her to make about $2000 RD Pesos (about $60 USD) more every month than she did before. She hopes to continue improving her juice stand and also wants to carry a larger variety of juices.  She will buy a blender to make the polular “baditas” drinks that combine fruit, ice, and milk. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She wants to thank everyone who is supporting her loan, and who has taken the time to read about her life and her business.

Having to feed two kids, he decided to start doing something well-paid so that he could pay the household costs, so 9 months ago he started to sell small bags of bread, sweet bread and toasted bread to grocery stores, all-purpose stores and certain houses.  Every morning he buys bread in the main market, and then goes to sell it to his clients that rely on him.  His wife supports him by selling soft drinks from home, all so that they can make it through and give their kids a good life.  He requires a loan to buy a motor to fit it to his bike, as this is the mode of transport he uses to sell the bread.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer &lt;b/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jorge hace algunos años quedó sin empleo, trabajaba de operario en una zona franca. Teniendo que alimentar a sus 2 hijos, opta por emprender una actividad que le fuera rentable y con la cual pudiera pagar los gastos del hogar y es desde hace 9 meses que se ha dedicado a distribuir bolsas de pan simple,  pan dulce y pan tostado a pulperías, misceláneas y casas particulares. Todas las mañanas compra el pan en el mercado mayoreo y posteriormente sale a venderlo a sus clientes fijos con los que cuenta Jorge. Su esposa lo apoya vendiendo refrescos en su vivienda, todo con el propósito de salir adelante y poder darles una vida cómoda a sus hijos. Requiere del préstamo para comprar un motor para instalarlo en su bicicleta que es su medio de transporte para vender el

She travels through the districts of Julcan and Usquil to buy and sell her products.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;She started her business when she received some cows as inheritance from her parents. She would take advantage of the milk of these animals to produce cheese and &lt;i&gt;cuajada&lt;/i&gt; (milk curd). Later, she found herself in the necessity of selling her cattle, and since then she would buy milk to continue with the cheese production. However, she realized that it was cheaper to buy the milk curd already made. Currently she buys 20 to 30 kg of milk curd, which she uses in part to prepare cheese and in part to sell directly.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Through a very close friend, she became part of the communal bank &quot;Women with Future&quot; in which she received her first loan for S/. 300.00 and with this money she bought chickens, guinea pigs, and small pigs.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;With the loan  for S/.1000.00, which she will pay in 4 moths, she will buy two young pigs and some milk curd.

She set up shop on a corner and sold her goods from a basket.  With her earnings she was eventually able to purchase a candy case in order to exhibit her sweets.  Over time she had the good idea of creating a small store in her house, and she began to purchase soft drinks and snacks. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Through a family member she was able to join the Communal Bank “Mujeres con Futuro” (Women with a future).  From this group she obtained her first loan of S/.300.00 (approximately $100 U.S.) with which she purchased several boxes of soft drinks. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The loan she is seeking is also for S/. 300.00 ($100 U.S.) to be paid back in four months.  With this loan Carmen will purchase two boxes of beer, some snacks, and some candies.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Carmen’s dream is to have a larger business.

There she bought ham, mutton, and pork, which she sold in the wholesaler’s market in Trujillo. Since marrying she has lived in the district of Mache and continued with the same type of business. Little by little, she became well known, and she now has a good clientele. In addition to selling meat, she also has a small grocery store in her home, where she sells basic goods. On the weekends she travels to Julcán, where she has a stand from which she sells threads, buttons, zippers, fabrics, etc. &lt;p&gt;She joined the “Mujeres de Trabajo” communal bank at the invitation of a cousin. She obtained her first loan of S/.300.00, with which she bought sewing notions so she could sell them in her community. &lt;p&gt;With this loan of S/. 1000.00, which she will repay in 4 months, she will buy 1 sack of rice, 1 sack of sugar, a box of cooking oil, and sewing notions to sell at her stand. &lt;p&gt;Nieves’ dream is for her children become professionals and for her business to continue prospering. &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;La señora Nieves Lola G.

She lives in Mache district, Otuzco province, La Libertad department, Peru. She has three dependent children. &lt;p&gt;Over time she has become a very successful businesswoman. Currently, she has an agriculture/veterinary supply store called “Otiniano”, where she sells plant medicines, fertilizers and insecticides (in both powder and liquid forms), pesticides, and other products for agricultural activities. At her business, she has installed a small vitrine in which she displays hardware products. &lt;p&gt;She studied Accounting, and when she finished her studies, she got a job with the municipality of Mache, where she worked for 6 years. She later married and started a family. Due to the need to stay at home to care for her children, she got the idea of starting up the business she currently has. Things have gone well for her, since she is the only person in the neighborhood who sells these products. She has always noticed the unmet needs of consumers and realized that there was no good place for visitors to stay in Mache, so she opened a small hostel. &lt;p&gt;She is one of the founding members of the “Mujeres con Futuro” (Women with a Future) communal bank, which she joined 5 years ago. The first loan she received was for S/. 300.00 and she used the money to start her agriculture/veterinary supply store. &lt;p&gt;With this loan of S/. 2000.00, which she will repay in 4 months, she will buy 1 box of Hieloxil, a product that is used to cure infections of potato plants and which is very much in demand during this season; 1 box of Tifón, which is for killing weevils; and 1 box of Extrafox. &lt;p&gt;Santos dreams of having another business location, which she would make into a large and modern hardware store. &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;La señora Santos Evelia Rodríguez A. tiene 40 años de edad.

The name Merta Nadi was chosen by the members of the group because Merti means &quot;immediate&quot; and Nadi means &quot;prosperity&quot; and Nadi is also the name of the street they live on. With all of their enthusiasm, Merta Nadi approached Denari to help them make raising pigs the right way easier.  Merta Nadi is asking for a loan to purchase high-quality pig feed, to help their sick pigs get well and to unsure that the control of their money is good in order.  After creation and training, Dinari now feels that the Merta Nadi group is ready to receive funding.  Merta Nadi consists of leader Ni Komang Santiani, secretary Ni Ketut Suari dan treasurer Ni Ketut Kongsi.  Merta Nadi has a total of 11 members.  The loan will be used to purchase a high quality boar and quality pig feed.  With these improvements the pigs they raise will be much higher quality than the pigs typically raised in their village.  All along, the members of Merta Nadi have been very diligent in their work.  With the help from the loan they receive the members of Merta Nadi believe that their business undertaking will be a success and really take off.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kiva.org/lender/courtenaychris&quot;&gt;Courtenay Teska Race&lt;/a&gt;, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Merta Nadi sebuah kelompok ternak Babi yang berlokasi di desa Candikusuma dimana sebagian besar masyarakatnya memeluk agama Hindu. Nama ini diberikan atas persetujuan anggota karena mempunyai arti bahwa Merta itu berarti Rejeki atau berkat sedangkan Nadi merupakan suatu jalan kehidupan. Sehingga Merta Nadi diberi arti oleh anggota kelompok kehidupan yang dipenuhi rejeki. Dengan keyakinan inilah anggota akhirnya mengajukan permohonan kepada Yayasan Dinari untuk mendapat pembinaan mengenai beternak babi seperti bagaimana cara beternak babi yang baik dan benar,cara pemberian pakan yang bagus, mengatasi penyakit babi secara cepat dan tepat,serta pengaturan keuangan yang benar agar modal untuk pakan ternak tidak habis untuk biaya dapur. Setelah pembinaan dan pelatihan dirasa cukup maka Yayasan Dinari memberi pinjaman modal kepada anggota kelompok Merta Nadi. Kelompok ini diketuai oleh Ni Komang Santiani ,Sekretaris Ni Ketut Suari dan Bendahara Ni Ketut Kongsi. Dengan jumlah anggota sebanyak 11 orang. Pinjaman modal yang diberikan oleh Yayasan Dinari dipergunakan untuk membeli bibit unggul dan pakan ternak  yang berkwalitas,maksudnya agar hasil yang diperoleh akan lebih bagus daripada memelihara babi lokal, yang selama ini mereka tekuni.&#13;&#10;&#9;Dengan adanya pembinaan dan dukungan modal dari Yayasan Dinari maka kelompok Merta Nadi berkeyakinan bahwa usahanya akan sukses dan berkembang bagus.</id></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1725</funded_amount><paid_amount>1725</paid_amount><image><id>131916</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>to

Her work hasn&apos;t lessened since she married her husband Putu Merta.  Her efforts in raising cattle have been recognized by her village organization since she was selected to receive a loan via Kiva and Dinari.  The funding she receives will be used to purchase a new cow.  Searching for grass for cattle to graze on is usually the job of men, but Ni Nengah Purnami says she is already used to doing it and wants to take care of her cattle.  Every morning at 6AM she brings grass for her cattle that she has prepared the evening before.  In the afternoons and evenings she goes out 2 times to search for new grazing land and to harvest food for her cattle.  She does this hard work to ensure her cattle and the cow she wants to purchase will be in the best health possible.  Luckily there is always fresh feed available in the fields.  During the farming season cattle are often used to help plow the farm fields in the community.  The profit she makes from her business is used to help improve the life of her family.  Besides renting out her cattle for use in the fields, she also prepares them for breeding so she can sell the calves or raise them for renting out to use in the fields.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kiva.org/lender/courtenaychris&quot;&gt;Courtenay Teska Race&lt;/a&gt;, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Menjadi peternak sapi adalah suatu kegiatan yang tidak pernah ditinggalkan bagi Ni Nengah Purnami semenjak menikah dengan Putu Merta. Melalui organisasi didesanya, Ni Nengah Purnami mendapat kepercayaan dan akhirnya mendapatkan dana pinjaman dari yayasan DINARI. Dana tersebut diperguanakan untuk membeli satu ekor induk sapi. Pada umumnya, mencari rumput untuk paka sapi adalah  pekerjaan yang sering dilakukan untuk seorang laki-laki. Bagi Ni Nengah Purnami itu adalah suatu pekerjaan yang sudah biasa dilakukannya. Setiap hari, mulai pukul 06.00 pagi, Ni Nengah Purnami memberi makan rumput yang sudah dipersiapkan kemarin sorenya. Sedang untuk siang hari dibiarkan di kebunnya untuk mencari makan sendiri. Menjelang malam hari, pukul 06.00 sore, diberi makan sekali lagi. Kegiatan ini dilakukan dengan harapan sapinya yang baru dibelinya tetap sehat. Persediaan pakan hijauan selalu tersedia dikebunnya. Pada musim tanam padi seringkali sapinya didisewa untuk membajak sawah oleh masyarakat sekitarnya.&#13;&#10;Penghasilan ini bisa untuk membantu dan menambah pendapatan bagi keluarganya. Selain dipakai untuk membajak, sapinya juga dipersiapkan untuk calon induk agar untuk kedepannya dapat menghasilkan anak sapi untuk dijual kembali atau untuk dikembangbiakkan.</id></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>131929</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>to

down from Ni Ketut Sukepen’s parents. Besides crafting them for her own use, she also provide the offering for some great Hindu ceremony, such as Odalan (Great ceremony to show gratitude to God), Otonan (baby birth family ceremony), and Ngaben (burial ceremony with means of fire). For those ceremony the production cost is high. Ni Ketut Sukepen even has to add worker to help her meeting the time whom she pays per diem. Through her village organization, she receives loan from Dinari foundation. She uses the loan to buy raw material. Almost everyday she buys variety of flowers and coconut leaves in the market. The daily cost of crafting Canang Sari is Rp. 50.000 (US$5) and get net income for Rp. 20.000 (US$2). From the business Ni Ketut Sukepen can help her husband, komang Tersen, who works as construction worker.&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Indonesian by Iman Persada, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketrampilan membuat  Canang Sari dan Banten ( sarana persembahyangan umat Hindu ) sudah diperoleh dari orang tuanya yang juga adalah seorang penjual Canang Sari. Selain membuat Canang Sari untuk sarana sembahyangan setiap hari, Ni Ketut Sukepen membuat dan melayani untuk sarana sembahyangan besar seperti  Odalan ( upacara adat skala besar untuk bersyukur kepada Tuhan ), Otonan ( upacara keluarga untuk menyambut kelahiran seorang bayi ) dan Ngaben ( upacara bakar mayat ). Untuk persembahyangan skala besar  biasanya memerlukan biaya cukup  banyak. Bahkan untuk mempercepat waktu pembuatan, Ni Ketut Sukepen harus menambah beberapa orang untuk membantu pekerjaannya agar selesai tepat waktu dan tenaga kerja ini dibayar secara harian.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;          Melalui oraganisasi yang ada didesanya, Ni Ketut Sukepen mendapat modal pinjaman dari Yayasan Dinari.

Pengeluaran untuk usaha Canang Sari dalam satu hari mencapai Rp.50.000,- dan memperoleh pendapatan bersih sekitar Rp. 20.000,- .dari usaha inilah Ni Ketut Sukepen dapat membantu menambah pendapatan suaminya,  Komang Tersen, yang berprofesi sebagai tukang

And they go to bed late in the night after making dough and preparing the firewood and coal for baking for the next day. Bimalika is selling the majority of her products just from her place.

Being the only breadwinner, Fatima is working hard. As any mother she is trying to ensure her kids have everything they may need, and she is dreaming to be able to pay for their higher education. Now Fatima is planning to increase the range of goods for selling. With this purpose she requests 1,000.00 Somoni (300.00 US Dollars) for the term of 5 months. Being the client of IMON for several years already, Fatima has proved herself as a reliable client and promises to pay the loan in time, expressing her gratitude.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>132007</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Purchasing foodstuffs like chocolate bars, sweets, soft drinks, juices, and toys in order to increase the range of goods for selling.</use><location><country_code>TJ</country_code><country>Tajikistan</country><town>Spitamen</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>39 71</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>100</partner_id><posted_date>2008-04-09T19:50:17Z</posted_date><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Fatima</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-04-23T22:52:49Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TJS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-05-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-06-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>60</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-13T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T03:33:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>208.06</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>209370</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>60</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2008-06-13T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T03:36:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>208.06</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>237411</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>60</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-13T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T03:39:04Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>208.06</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>266269</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>60</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-13T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T03:42:20Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>208.06</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>295267</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>60</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-13T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-14T07:27:59Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>208.04</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>325901</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-04-09T22:52:49Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-09-14T07:27:59Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>37711</id><name>Ruth</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Twenty-eight year-old Ruth M. is married with one child, aged three.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ruth owns a clothing business.

Rahmatulloevich lives in the Fayzabad region. He is 52 years old, married and has 6 children. He has a college degree in agronomy. He is in the business of raising cattle. He purchase calves, raises them and resells them at the market at a profit. Raising a calf takes about 40-45 days. After selling the animal he uses the obtained money to purchase new calves that he raises and resells as well. He has more than 6 years experience working in this business. This business is the main source of income for his family and therefore Karomat makes sure that it functions very well. In addition to being crucial to the wellbeing of the N. family, the business also provides local butchers and therefore local markets with affordable meat. Karomat plans to use the money from the loan to purchase another calf to raise.

Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Firstly, they require little start-up capital, you can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. There are probably hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow!</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>132023</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Poultry</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

He is in the business of selling scrap metals, rubber, bottles, and other odds and ends; a business that he inherited from his father. Businesses buy his industrial material and, from that, he makes a living for his small family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His wife, Celeste, works as a hairdresser when she is not at home caring for their young girls.

Gladis has been a member for five years and Herlinda for one year.  In that time they have learned responsibility, punctuality and improved their business skills.  They say that in the community bank not only have they learned valuable skills but have found support and companionship.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Gladis is 34 years old.  She is married and has four children, aged fifteen and younger.  Gladis has a store where she sells tara.  Tara is a type of tree that is typical of the region; the fruit from the tree is used to make industrial products.  She has been selling tara for several years, but was only able to open her store since joining the community bank.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Herlinda has been a member of the community bank for one year.  She speaks some Spanish, but mainly Quechua; luckily with the help of Gladis we were able to understand each other.  Herlinda sells Tara and cochinilla, which is a small insect used to make red dye.  She collects the products in the countryside and then sells them to a middleman who takes them to Lima.  &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Gladis and Herlinda need loans of 900 and 300 soles (3 soles = $1), which they will invest in their businesses by buying more tara and cochinilla.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;One of the most important featured of the community bank is the interest-earning savings account each associate has.  Gladis and Herlinda plan to use their savings in the case of an emergency and to make more capital available to their business.  Their dreams are to continue developing their businesses.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>132089</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Gladis

He uses his motorcycle as a “mototaxi”.  At home his wife tends to her little artisan bakery in their home.  This couple lives with their children in their own house, which is located near the Warnes stadium.  Jose has worked in the area of public transportation for various years, and is part of  the October 30 association.  He also has a lot of experience with his wife’s bakery, where she makes and sells the bread which is a primary staple.  The competition in both fields is medium, but the antiquity of the work, the agreement with clients, the location, and the type of articulation that they offer are factors that helps them have a consistent clientele.  Jose wants to buy a motorcycle for $600usd which is like the bike that can be seen in the photo.   This is the 4th time he has barrowed money, and during that time he has proven to be a punctual and responsible with his repayments.  At the moment he has no other debts or outstanding credit.  &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from Spanish by James Lombardo Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&#13;&#10;Jose tiene 51 años de edad y es transportista de pasajeros en el radio urbano, maneja su moto para prestar sus servicios como mototaxista, por otra parte su esposa atiende su pequeña panadería artesanal en su domicilio.&#13;&#10;Esta pareja vive con sus hijos en casa propia que se encuentra ubicada por la zona del stadium de Warnes, actualmente la casa no esta registrada a su nombre.&#13;&#10;Jose trabaja en el rubro del transporte público desde hace varios años atrás, siendo parte también de la Asociación 30 de Octubre, paralelamente también tienen bastante experiencia con la panadería que administra su esposa, donde ella elabora y comercializa el pan que es un artículo de primera necesidad.&#13;&#10;La competencia en ambos rubros es media, pero la antiguedad de trabajo, el trato a los clientes, la ubicación y el tipo de artículo que ofrecen (pan) son factores que les ayuda a tener clientela constantemente.&#13;&#10;El cliente comprará una moto en $us. 600.- y que es exactamente la moto que se puede ver en la fotografía.&#13;&#10;Esta es la cuarta operación de Jose con la instución, y en este tiempo de relación demostró ser una persona puntual y responsable en sus pagos.

Today, it’s a lot harder to start your own business as a public van driver. Currently, Sergey’s net profit is about $500 a month. An economical diesel engine in his vehicle helps him reduce his operating costs and adds to his bottom line. Loans that Sergey has received from “Nadiya Ukraine” have helped to promote stability and growth in his business. Sergey is asking for a loan of $1,200 to purchase necessary car parts and fix his van. He understands the effort and commitment it takes to be a private entrepreneur, and is willing to work hard in his business to be able to support his family which is the first priority in his

For the last five years she has been working for AHIMSA, an organization that provides free food, education and medicines to children from low income families in the Memorial Sandino neighborhood.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mariana is the coordinator of AHIMSA&apos;s Family Social Program, and her social work with this program has contributed to the continued development of her community.  What she earns for her work with this organization has been very beneficial, as it allows her to pay for her son&apos;s studies.  He is currently studying to be able to obtain employment that will further his development.  Mariana&apos;s husband currently works for Enacal [Nicaragua&apos;s state water and sewage utility].  Mariana and her husband have been working to improve their family&apos;s quality of life, and right now their most pressing need is to be able to finish construction on their house&apos;s porch.  They have been unable to complete the project because they don&apos;t have the resources to do so.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Chegezy, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Doña Mariana tiene 54 años de edad, habita con su hijo en el barrio Villa Flor de Managua, hace 5 años trabaja en una Asociación llamada AHIMSA que opera en el barrio Memorial Sandino, en donde apadrinan a niños con padres de escasos recursos económicos, brindándoles alimentación, educación y medicina gratuita. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ella coordina el Programa Social Familiar que realiza esta asociación, en donde su labor social ha contribuido al desarrollo integral de su comunidad. La ayuda que recibe la señora de parte del organismo por su trabajo, le ha sido de mucho beneficio, ya que con lo que percibe paga los estudios universitarios de su hijo, quien se esta preparando para llegar a obtener un puesto laboral en el cual se pueda desarrollar, el esposo de doña Mariana trabaja en Enacal. Estos padres han ido mejorando su condición de vida, la necesidad mayor de esta familia es la de terminar de construir el porche de su casa,  ya que la construcción se encuentra detenida por falta de capital.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>825</funded_amount><paid_amount>825</paid_amount><image><id>132150</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Services</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Purchase

Alcarizzos.  She lives with her two children, a boy and a girl. She and her husband divorced several years ago and since then she has been left to support the three of them on her own.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Right now she has a small little store that sells earrings, trinkets, beauty supplies and sandals. She is asking for this loan so that she can expand her supply and expand her business.  She believes that with better and more inventory, she will be able to sell more and retain her customers.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In the little free time that she can find, Ana Josefa loves to go to her church, watch the local news, and maybe even catch one of the famously dramatic telenovelas that air every night.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;From Ana Josefa, and from all of us here at

She is happily married and loves her kids more than anything else in the world. When she is not working she enjoys reading her Bible. With her first loan funded by Kiva, she was able to begin running her own business selling clothing to other people in her community. With this next loan she hopes to expand her business. Her goal is to have a boutique in Puerto Plata that sells nice clothes and shoes. She would also like to expand her home because there are nine people and not much room! &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;This Bank of Hope has been part of Esperanza’s microfinance program for over a year. Three of the four groups are applying for their second loan and one group is applying for the first time. The group of twenty women is very diverse: some have come over to the DR with their families from Haiti, and others were born and raised here.  For these five women, this is an opportunity they have only dreamed of.  Because it actually costs money in the Dominican Republic to even save money – its unfathomable for these women to think that they would be offered a loan from someone besides a greedy loan shark, much less an organization that anticipates their personal growth and success. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Esperanza, Shely, and the entire group we would like express our gratitude for your generosity and

14, 12, 9, 6, 4, 2 and 4 months). Her husband is currently unemployed and has found it very difficult to secure a job. She currently has problems providing for her children – they are often sick with either a cold or asthma. Her 4 year old son, David, suffers from a chronic illness. She currently sells clothing from her home but hopes that one day she will have her own “colmado,” which is a very small grocery store. She is looking forward to this loan because it will allow her to expand her business and buy more clothing to sell. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;This group lives in a small community about 40 minutes outside of Puerto Plata. Most of the people in the community are Haitian and came to the Dominican Republic in hopes of finding a better life. Jobs are extremely difficult to come by here; the unemployment rate in these smaller towns can be as high as 25%. Disease and sickness are very prevalent in this specific area due to the lack of capital available for medical care or medicine. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;This is a very close and tight knit group. They rely on each other for emotional and financial support. With the loan from Kiva and business skills and supervision from Esperanza, these individuals are able to pursue their dreams and start their own small businesses. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Oh behalf of Esperanza and everyone in this group, thank you for your continued support and generosity. God Bless!</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1500</funded_amount><paid_amount>1500</paid_amount><image><id>132225</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

They live in a rural area called Villa Reconciliacion.  The region is very poor and crime is a problem.   Silvia has fought on her own to provide for her children, making sure they have an education so that they will be able to pursue professions and improve their lives.   In order to meet all her obligations, she works selling clothing, perfumes and cosmetics to her friends and neighbors.  The income from this has enabled her to pay her household costs. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Because of the cost of food and basic services, Silvia decided to fix up a small room in her house so that she could rent it out to a couple, increasing her income and doing her best to provide for  the needs of her children.  But the rains have been heavy the last few months, causing some damage to the room and the wooden walls and now the renters are asking that she fixes it.   She is requesting a loan to buy supplies to rebuild the walls from concrete.  This will allow her to offer a nicer room to the tenants, as well as collect more rent. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora Silvia es madre soltera, tiene tres hijos de 13, 16 y 17 años, los cuales están estudiando, habitan en el asentamiento de Villa Reconciliación,  zona rural, muy pobre, existe mucha delincuencia. Esta madre ha luchado sola por sacar adelante a sus hijos, le ha brindado lo necesario para vivir, como es la educación, la cual desea poderlos preparar para que sean profesionales de bien y opten a mejores condiciones de vida en donde se puedan desarrollar como individuo. Para poder cumplir con todas las obligaciones, esta madre trabaja de operaria en una zona franca, oportunidad en la que ha aprovechado para comercializar ropa, perfumes y cosméticos a las trabajadores de esa maquila así como a sus amistades y vecinas, ingresos que le han permitido pagar los gastos del hogar. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Debido a lo costoso de los alimentos y servicios básicos, decide acondicionar un pequeño cuarto en su humilde vivienda con láminas de zinc y madera, el cual alquila a una pareja, es con todo esto que esta madre hace frente a satisfacer las necesidades básicas de sus hijos, todo con el objetivo de brindarles un mejor nivel de vida a su familia. Las abundantes lluvias de meses pasados, deterioraron el cuarto, ya que las paredes del cuarto son de madera, por lo cual están podridas y es por eso que los inquilinos le están solicitando a la señora que mejore el cuarto, ya que se encuentra en muy malas condiciones, viendo esta situación la señora solicita un préstamo para construir de concreto las paredes del cuarto y brindar un mejor servicio lo que le ayudara a pedir un mejor precio por el alquiler.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes &lt;/p&gt;</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>132228</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>TO PURCHASE CEMENT, SAND AND IRON TO REPAIR THE WALLS ON A ROOM SHE RENTS OUT IN HER HOUSE.

He inherited the business from his father, and dedicates himself to the creation of a wide range of bakery goods.   His business is located in Waspan Sur, and has been growing over the years, with a team of people who  help make the bread and distributors who deliver it to the markets, cafes, general stores and private homes.   Through his business, Rodolfo has generated employment for others, even though he has only a small number of employees, he has supported them and helped them. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; With his profits, he would like to buy some equipment which would allow him to offer his bakery goods in the various plazas and centers of Managua.   Right now the costs of the business and the ingredients are high and the cost of bread is also higher.  The demand has not diminished, but it&apos;s more difficult for him to buy the necessary ingredients.  Rodolfo is requesting a loan to purchase necessary ingredients, enabling him  to produce the same quantity needed to meet his customers requests. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rodolfo es un panadero con muchos años de experiencia en esta actividad, inicia desde las cuatro de la mañana, el negocio fue una herencia de su padre, el cual hoy en día administra y se dedica a elaborar una gama de panes como pan dulce, simple, tostado, picos, galletas tostadas, entre otros. Tiene 30 años de tener su negocio, el cual se encuentra ubicado en Waspan Sur, este ha ido creciendo con el pasar de los años, cuenta con personas que le ayudan en el proceso de elaboración así como también distribuidores que se encargan de repartir en pulperías, mercados, cafetines y casas particulares las bolsas de pan. De esta forma ha contribuido a la generación de empleos, ya que a pesar que su personal es mínimo, le ha sido de mucho aporte al crecimiento del mismo. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Con sus ganancias tiene el deseo de  comprar un equipo rodante en el que puedan ofrecer su pan en las diferentes plazas y centros de Managua. En estos momentos los costos de los insumos de trabajo o ingredientes se encuentran a precios altos, aumentando el precio del pan pero por ser este de mucha demanda la venta no disminuye pero la capacidad de compra de ingredientes si se hace mas difícil,  es por eso que el señor necesita un préstamo con el cual pueda adquirir su materia prima y así producir la misma cantidad con la que esta trabajando para satisfacer de esta manera la demanda de sus clientes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes

He has been responsible for their care and education since his wife abandoned him and left the children in his care.  He has always worked hard to improve their quality of life.  They live in a very poor neighborhood called Luareles Sur, a rural area without basic services. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The living conditions of this family are very humble, with dirt floors, one main room, a roof damaged by the constant rain and sun.  Jose works as a security guard and has not been able to earn enough to repair his house.  With this  loan, he will make the repairs on his house so that his children can develop and grow up in a dignified way.  The most urgent requirement is for materials to patch the cracked walls, which have lifted up in the strong winds and rains of recent months. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;José es un padre de familia soltero, de 40 años de edad, a su cargo están sus 2 hijos 5 y 7 años, a los cuales cuida, alimenta, educa en base a las posibilidades económicas con las que cuenta el señor, su esposa lo abandonó dejándoles a los niños a su cargo, siempre ha trabajado para sacar adelante a su familia, habita con sus pequeños hijos en el asentamiento Laureles Sur, un barrio muy pobre, rural, en donde no cuentan con todos los servicios básicos. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La vivienda de esta familia es muy humilde, no se encuentra en buenas condiciones, el piso es de tierra, no existe división en la casa, el techo se encuentra dañado debido a las constantes lluvias del invierno y el sol, todo esto debido a la falta de mantenimiento inmediato de su vivienda, Trabaja como guarda de seguridad y no ha podido realizarle mejoras a su vivienda. El préstamo de este  señor es para acondicionar su vivienda en donde sus hijos se puedan desarrollar dignamente, la necesidad mayor en estos momentos es la de cambiar el zinc de la vivienda, ya que se encuentra con sarro, rajado y ciertas partes están levantadas por los fuertes vientos y lluvias que azotaron en meses pasados.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes

Renecer Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Rudilani is the coordinator of the Bank of Hope, Nuevo Renacer, which roughly translates to “rebirth” in English. Their Bank of Hope is the first such group to be formed in their community of La Barquita and they are proud to be part of the new relationship between their community and Esperanza International.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Rudilania is a 28 year old woman who lives with her husband. They have one daughter together but due to tough economic circumstances their daughter lives with her grandmother.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Rudilania has asked for this loan to start a new business selling clothing. She plans to make a part of her small house a sales room and will travel around her neighborhood to market her new store.  Specifically, she is excited to begin selling new mens&apos; and womens&apos; jeans, as well as blouses and undergarments.  She will purchase the clothes from a market in Santo Domingo called Villa Consuelo, an area famous for high-quality, imported clothes at discount prices. Through the training she received from Esperanza, she learned that purchasing clothes at a wholesale discount, or at a small discount, substantially increases her profit margin, and consequently enables her to generate more income.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her biggest goal is to provide a better life for her daughter and give her what she herself never had growing up.  Her personal goal is to continue studying and to graduate from the medical school she has been studying at.  Rudilani is being trained in dialysis and blood work, as well as in providing vaccinations.  Her biggest challenges revolve around the lack of opportunity to improve her business and to work.  For the first time in a year and a half, Esperanza International is giving her the opportunity to return to work and create a stable income for her family.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In her free time, she likes to spend as much time as she can with her daughter, as well as study, read, and go to her local church.  Rudilania sincerely thanks everyone who is supporting not just her loan, but also the loans of her group members.  She says that without opportunities like these, they are not able to move forward with their lives and live the lives that they know they can.  On behalf of everyone here at Esperanza, and the entire Nuevo Renacer Bank of Hope, we thank you for your support!</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>132238</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Her husband works as a bricklayer, and they  have two children ages 6 and 8 who attend school.   The family lives in an area called Laureles Sur, a very poor neighborhood with dirt streets and shortages of drinkable water.  Karla decided to start  a business in their small house, selling new and used clothing to help her husband with the household costs.   She offers her products on credit and that is how her business has survived.   Her greatest hope is to finish with the construction of their simple house, a process that has taken a lot of time because they haven&apos;t had the economic resources.  She is requesting a loan to be able to buy construction materials to change the front door so they have more security in their home.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Karla Patricia tiene 32 años de edad, su esposo trabaja como albañil, tienen 2 hijos de 6 y 8 años de edad, están estudiando en primaria, esta familia habita en Laureles Sur, es un asentamiento pobre, en donde las calles no son pavimentadas, existe escasez de agua potable,  la señora Karla Jiron decide montar su pequeño negocio en su humilde vivienda el cual consiste en vender ropa variada nueva o usada a precios bajos, para apoyar a su esposo con todos los gastos familiares, ofrece sus productos al crédito y es así como ha sobrevivido. El mayor deseo de la señora es la de terminar de construir su vivienda, proceso que le ha llevado mucho tiempo debido a la falta de recursos económicos inmediatos, es por eso que solicita un préstamo

She is asking for a loan so that for the first time she will have extra capital to buy more merchandise to expand her business.  Specifically, she wants to buy ingredients in bulk to cut down on cost, as well as occasionally buying a wider variety of meats to sell that she hasn’t been able to afford before.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She lives with her two children and husband in a small community outside of the capital, Santo Domingo.  Her dream is to watch her children graduate high school, go to one of the universities in Santo Domingo and become professionals.  For herself, her dream is to own a bakery and dessert shop where she can sell what she loves making most: breads and cakes.  She also hopes at one point to return to school herself.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Maria&apos;s biggest challenge to overcome is not a lack of money, or poverty, but rather the insecurity and doubt she harbors in herself — it is hard for her to understand that she really is capable of improving her life and doing better for her family.  Thankfully, with the help of Esperanza, and the group lending method, she is supported by her group members and learning to overcome this insecurity—she says they help her believe more strongly in herself.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of everyone at Esperanza, and on behalf of Maria and her group members, we thank you for your support!</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>132246</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

Carmen looked for an alternative to generate income to cover their costs, and so she works as a cook in a small eatery.  Together, both parents fight to give their children a better quality of life, where they will have dignity, protection and security. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; The economic situation of these parents has not allowed them to fix the infrastructure on their small home, as they&apos;ve made the education of their children the priority.  For this reason, they are requesting a loan so they may begin some basic repairs on their house, patching the walls and the living area.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Doña Carmen es una madre de 51 años de edad, habita con su familia en el humilde asentamiento Laureles Norte, tiene 3 hijos quienes dependen de ella, el esposo de la señora trabaja como albañil por cuenta propia, oficio con el cual aporta en los gastos del hogar, no siendo esto suficiente, la señora buscó otra alternativa de obtener ingresos que le permita subsanar todos los gastos de la casa, es por eso que trabaja de cocinera en una comidería. Juntos estos padres luchan por brindarles a sus hijos mejores condiciones de vida, en donde cuenten con una vivienda digna, la cual les genere protección y seguridad. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La situación económica de estos padres no les ha permitido mejorar la infraestructura de su pequeña vivienda, ya que han priorizado la alimentación y educación de sus hijos.  Es por eso que en estos momentos solicitan un préstamo con el cual puedan iniciar algunas  mejoras a su vivienda, como es cambiar el zinc de los cuartos de los hijos y embaldosar la

He learned how to cultivate local crops from his father when he was 15 years old.   At his young age, he has two plots of good quality, productive land which he works.    March and April are the best months for planting, and Bismark is able to get two harvests during the year.  He needs a loan to buy more organic materials needed for the cultivation and harvesting process.   With the income he generates he can pay his costs, as well as help his parents financially.  His most important goal is to build a better home for his parents where they can live a tranquil and safe life.

En el verano (Marzo-Abril), es la época donde se asienta de mejor manera el cultivo, ya que necesitan de estar expuestas a los rayos del sol, requieren de riego constante pero teniendo en cuenta que el exceso de humedad perjudica el suelo, al año el joven saca dos producciones de pitahaya, ya sea en los meses de  mayo a agosto o septiembre. El joven requiere de un préstamo para comprar insumos orgánicos que requiere en todo el proceso productivo del cultivo, ya que con los ingresos que genera la producción se paga sus gastos, con su trabajo  apoya económicamente a sus padres, el mayor deseo de Bismarck, es el de construirle una mejor vivienda a sus padres en la que puedan vivir su vejez de manera tranquila y segura, por lo que

He produces pineapples and has been in this industry for 15 years. This has allowed him to maintain the life of his wife and two children who are studying in primary and grade school. His wife supports the family by helping out with household tasks, takes care of the kids and vends his products in different stores with her husband. He dedicates as much time in the production of the product. The manufacturing requires much investment at high costs. These investments include organic chemicals for the soil and plantations. Sometimes he also does other activities like bricklaying in order to gain extra income so he can pay off other expenses like daily diets, educating his kids and pay for basic services. In these times, he needs to buy fertilizer to help him develop his pineapples and his crop to be successful. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;This story has been translated from Spanish to English by Nikita Ramchandani, KIVA Volunteer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;Don Santos tiene 37 años, es originario de la comunidad de La Borgoña - Ticuantepe, se dedica a producir piña, posee 15 años de dedicarse a esta actividad, la cual le ha permitido mantener a su esposa y sus 2 hijos, quienes se encuentran estudiando en primaria y secundaria, la esposa lo apoya realizando los quehaceres del hogar, cuidando de los niños y comercializa el producto en los diferentes mercados con su esposo.  El señor le dedica el mayor tiempo posible al mantenimiento de la producción, el cual conlleva un proceso artesanal manufacturero que requiere de mucha inversión debido a los altos costos de los productos y químicos orgánicos que requiere el suelo y las plantaciones. En ocasiones el señor realiza otras actividades como albañilería, con el objetivo de percibir ingresos extras que le permitan subsanar todos los gastos como la alimentación diaria, educación de los hijos y pago de servicios básicos. En estos momentos el señor necesita comprar fertilizantes para que le ayude al desarrollo de las piñas y su cosecha sea todo un éxito.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>132265</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Ketut Suwandri</name><description><languages type="list"><language>id</language></languages><texts><id>Ni Ketut Suwadri and her husband, I Gede Suwendra, have been in the business of making brown coconut  sugar for a long time. They have 3 children whom all of them have their own families now. Apart from the brown sugar making business, she is also a farmer. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ni Ketut and her husband use 20 coconuts/ day for producing brown sugar. Her husband climbs the coconut tree twice a day to get these coconuts. In the afternoon, they slice the coconut to get the coconut juice as the main ingredients for the brown sugar. They keep the juice in bottles for a night and the next morning they put the juice in a big wok (cooking pan) and they steam the juice in the wok. This cooking process takes 3 hours. The juice becomes a bit of gel - like substance and they put these into the coconut shells that have been cut into half. Then they let these to cool down inside the coconut shells. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Everyday they can produce up to 6 kg of brown coconut sugar. The sugar is sold to regular customers who buy them once a week. The selling price is IDR 6 thousand per kg of sugar (around USD 0.65). In one month they can earn up to IDR 1,080,000 (around USD 118). &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The money from Dinari will be used to buy another 3 big woks. These woks cost around IDR 2.5 million (around USD   275). The rest of the money will be used to buy slicing knifes and 20 bottles. These production utensils are required to enable them to increase the production capacity. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ni Ketut Suwadri dan suaminya, I Gede Suwendra, sudah lama menekuni usaha membuat gula merah. Ni Ketut Suwadri memiliki 3 orang anak dan semuanya sudah berumah tangga. Selain usaha gula merah, Ni Ketut Suwadri juga seorang petani. Ni Ketut Suwadri dan suaminya selalu bekerja sama dalam usahanya. Ni Ketut Suwadri dan suaminya memanfaatkan 20 pohon kelapa yang dipakai gula merah. Setiap hari suaminya memanjat pohon kelapa 2 kali . Sore hari,  untuk mengiris bakal buah yang masih muda supaya bisa keluar air gula, dan pada pagi hari menurunkan air gula yang ada pada jrigen. Setelah itu Ni Ketut Suwadri menaruhnya kedalam wajan yang besar dan direbus. Proses pembuatan gula merah hingga siap dicetak menghabiskan waktu 3 jam. Setelah adonan mengental, lalu dicetak kedalam tempurung kelapa yang sudah disiapkan. Setiap hari Ni Ketut Suwadri mampu memproduksi 6 kg gula merah. Ni Ketut Suwadri mempunyai pelanggan tetap yang setiap 1 minggu membeli gula merahnya. Harga 1 kg gula merah sekarang ini Rp. 6.000.- Setiap satu bulan dari penghasilan gula merah Ni Ketut Suwadri mendapat uang Rp.1.080.000,-. Modal yang dipinjam dari Dinari  untuk membeli 3 wajan besar yang harganya mencapai Rp. 2.500.000,-  sisanya untuk membeli pisau iris dan 20 jrigen. Peralatan itu dibeli untuk menunjang proses produksi agar mendapat hasil yang lebih maksimal. Ni Ketut Suwadri bersyukur mendapat pinjaman dana dari Dinari.</id></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>132305</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home Products

Her first kid is 15 year old and he is in junior high school. Her 2nd kid is 9 year old and he is in Primary school. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She bought 2 female breeding pigs for IDR 2 million (around USD 220). She farms them in traditional ways. She doesn&apos;t keep her pigs in a hut as she doesn&apos;t have money to build one. She plans to build a pig hut once she succeed in selling the piglets produced by her breeding pigs. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;One of her pig is now pregnant. The other one has just delivered 8 piglets recently. When these piglets are 2 month old, she will be able to sell them for IDR 200 thousand/ piglet (around USD 22), so in total she can earn a revenue of USD 175 from the selling of 8 piglets. She hopes the pregnant pig can deliver safely.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Kadek Ayu Ardani memiliki 2 orang anak. Anak yang pertama berumur 15 tahun duduk dibangku SMP. Anaknya yang kedua berumur 9 tahun duduk dibangku SD. Kadek Ayu Ardani memiliki 2 induk babi lokal yang sudah siap dikawinkan. 2 induk babi ini dibeli dengan harga Rp. 2.000.000.- Ayu Ardani memberi makan masih secara tradisional yaitu dengan memberi daun talas yang sudah direbus lalu dicampurkan dengan dedak padi. Cara pemeliharaannya juga masih secara tradisional, karena belum ada dana tambahan untuk membuat kandang. Rencananya kalau induknya berhasil, Ayu Ardani akan membuat kandang yang permanen. 2 induknya sekarang sudah hamil dan yang satu sudah melahirkan 8 ekor anak babi. Ayu Ardani sangat telaten dalam mengurus induk dan anaknya. Umur 2 bulan anaknya dijual dengan harga 1 ekor babi Rp. 200.000.- jadi total semuanya Rp.1.600.000.- Harapan Ayu Ardani, 1 induknya lagi bisa melahirkan dengan selamat.</id></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>132307</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

My husband is a farmer and I stitch clothes for my neighborhood clients. Now, I want a loan to buy a new sewing machine and invest in high quality notions. I am a mother of an only daughter and I want to give her a sound economic future. There are four other women in my loan group; all of them will invest their share of loans in their own or in their family’s businesses. I have known these women for a long time and completely trust them. They are:  Uzma M., who runs a beauty salon and needs to buy cosmetics and small equipment; Razia B., who will use this loan to buy poultry feed and hens for her husband’s poultry farm;  Zia I.,who requires this loan to buy a rickshaw for her husband; and  Rukhsana N., who needs this loan to expand their furniture store.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another&apos;s loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1100</funded_amount><paid_amount>1100</paid_amount><image><id>132347</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Tailoring</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Buy

He is 46 years old, is married and has 6 children.  Mahmadrajab has a college education and is a veterinarian by profession.  He raises livestock.  Mahmadrajab purchases calves, fattens them for 40-45 days and then resells them at a higher price when they are worth more and are used for meat.  He then purchases new calves and repeats the process.  This is his business model.  This business helps to support his family as Mahmadrajab is the sole earner in his family. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The expansion of the livestock sector allows for the provision of markets with quality meat at affordable prices.  Mahmadrajab has been in the livestock business for 22 years and will use this loan to purchase more calves.  He will pay back the loan over a 12 month period.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Бобиев Махмадраджаб  житель района Абдурахмони Джоми.

Currently he owns two cows and needs to buy an additional cow so that our income can increase. The other women with me who need loans are Yasmeen B., who will buy a rickshaw with her share of loan, and  Asiah K., who will pay-off the remaining installments of her family&apos;s rickshaw. All of these women are hardworking entrepreneurs and need loans to improve their families&apos; businesses.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another&apos;s loans.

I am married and a mother of two: one boy and one girl. I live with my family in the mid-sized industrial city of Faisalabad, Pakistan. I stitch clothes for women of my neighborhood and my husband runs a grocery store. My husband needs a loan to improve his business. The higher profits that we hope to receive will be saved for our children&apos;s future. I would like to borrow in a group: Shalika Shrafat needs this loan to buy pesticides and fertilizers for their fields, Parween A. plans to start a grocery store and Shahnaz A. will invest her share of the loan in her husband’s auto lubricants store.  All of these women are hardworking entrepreneurs and dream of a prosperous life for their families.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another&apos;s loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are

Things became very difficult for her when her husband died. She depended on her husband because her parents died when she was still very young. She was forced into marriage immediately after the death of her father. She is not educated and she depended greatly on her husband’s daily income until his death. With all of these difficulties and too much sickness on her part, she was convinced to join GHAPE in 1999 by a very good friend.&lt;p&gt;She took out loans of $30 in 1999, $100 in 2000, $100 in 2001, and $200 in 2002. She invested the loans in farming of yams and cassava. Her achievements are countless, she pays schools fees to her children, spent some to learn a trade, and lastly she repaired her house.&lt;p&gt;Given a loan, she plans to continue her farm work, and believes that her business will be successful because she has experience in farming of yam and cassava. With the profits, she intends to educate her children, save some money, and provide food for her family.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>132435</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Farming

I was born in the second largest city, Lahore, Pakistan, but then moved to KRK after my marriage 15 years ago. I have six boys and one girl. All of my children attend school and I wish them a bright future. In the morning my husband sells cloth in his shop and he drives a rickshaw in the evening. These two businesses generate decent profits for us, but my husband feels that as our children are growing so are their needs, and therefore we want to save for their higher education. As a result, we have decided to expand our cloth business and hence we need a loan. I would like this loan in a group with five other women. These women are needy and want financial assistance to grow their businesses.  Haleema B. wants a loan for their restaurant. Parween B. will buy a donkey cart. Sumaira A. plans to invest her share of the loan in her family’s tailoring shop. Basheeran B. is borrowing for her husband’s clothing sales business. Rasheeda B. will invest in her son&apos;s mobile phone shop.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another&apos;s loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1600</funded_amount><paid_amount>1600</paid_amount><image><id>132444</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

She trained as a seamstress but she does not have an appropriate workshop where she can do her sewing, so she is asking for a small loan. This will allow her to purchase a new sewing machine and rent a workshop. The very positive evolution of her business venture makes it necessary for Mrs. B. to have more capital at her disposition. This plan will bring in supplementary income so that she will be better able to support her family. &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Née à Lomé le 14 Juillet 1975, Madame B. Afoua Thérèse est divorcée et à en charge six (6) personnes. Couturière de formation, elle ne dispose pas d’un atelier de couture approprié pour exercer son métier et sollicite donc un financement sous forme de crédit. Ce fonds lui permettra d’une part à acquérir une nouvelle machine à coudre et louer un atelier. L’évolution très positive de ses activités oblige Madame B. à disposer plus de moyens financiers  et ce projet lui apportera un revenu supplémentaire pour mieux subvenir aux besoins de sa famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>132453</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Tailoring</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Purchase

father of eight children. A customs officer who is presently jobless, Mr. K. has a little shed that he would like to outfit as a general store. In order to do that, he is requesting a Kiva loan that he plans to use to purchase goods so as to open his little grocery shop for the people in his neighborhood. This will allow him to increase his income and improve living conditions for his family. &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Né à Anfoin (P/Lacs) le 31 décembre 1961, Monsieur K. Akakpo Kossi est marié et père de huit (8) enfants. Déclarant en douane sans emploi, il dispose d’un petit magasin qu’il veut réaménager en boutique pour la vente des produits d’alimentation générale. Pour cela il sollicite à travers ce projet un prêt qui lui servira de s’approvisionner en marchandises et ouvrir sa boutique d’alimentation générale pour les habitants de son quartier. Ceci lui permettra d’accroître ses revenus et ainsi améliorer les conditions de vie de sa famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>132469</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Previously being an operator, she quickly left this job to start her own business selling telephone recharge cards. Being a very friendly person, she quickly attracted many customers and now she is often confronted with diminished stock.  In order to improve her business, she is asking for a loan in order to ensure she will always have sufficient stock and be able to satisfy customer demand. With realization of this dream will give her higher revenue and consequently an improved standard of living for her family. &lt;p&gt;Translated from French to English by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Agée de 45 ans, Madame K. Ayi Kokoè Ida est mariée et mère de cinq (5) enfants. Etant Opératrice de saisie, elle a vite laissé cet emploi et s’est lancée dans le commerce de vente de cartes de recharge.

Pour mettre fin à cette situation, elle sollicite un financement afin d’avoir en permanence de stock et satisfaire la demande de sa clientèle.

A bachelor, he opened a cafeteria-cafe, financed by his meager savings. So as to improve this endeavor, he is asking for a loan which will aid him in purchasing sufficient provisions for his cafeteria-cafe so as to run smoothly, such as milk, sugar, coffee, and eggs among others. With these provisions, he hopes to expand his current cafeteria-cafe into a restaurant, because his customer demand is very high. Completing this project will make it so that he does not have to go to the market every day, which leaves him more time to run his store and will result in higher revenue which he sorely needs to improve his daily standard of living. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Translated from French to English by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Monsieur A. Kodjo est né en 1982 et réside à Lomé. Célibataire, il détient une cafétéria financée par ses maigres moyens. A partir de ce projet, il sollicite un prêt afin de s’approvisionner en quantité suffisante de lait, sucre, café, œufs et autres, et faire d’autres provisions pour un restaurant sur la demande de sa clientèle. La réalisation de ce projet lui permettre de ne plus aller tous les jours au marché et ainsi augmenter ses revenus en vue d’améliorer ses conditions de

This will make it possible for him to expand his business and take charge of his career and his future. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Translated by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Né à Lomé le 09 Juillet 1981, Monsieur Z.

Coming from a very poor family, he did not have the opportunity to go to school. He is married and the father of two children. In addition to agriculture, he runs a little farm of small ruminants and poultry. He thus does not have the means to build a sheep pen, obtain water troughs, mangers and the like.   He is requesting financial support in the form of a loan. Achieving this project will help him and his family truly flourish. &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monsieur A. Yao est né à Gapé (P/Zio) en 1975. Issu d’une famille très pauvre, il n’avait pas eu la chance d’étudier. Marié, il est le père de deux (2) enfants. En plus de l’agriculture, il entretien un petit élevage de petits ruminants et de volailles. Ainsi, ses moyens ne lui permettent pas de faire face aux besoins de construction de paillote de bergerie, de se doter des abreuvoirs, mangeoires et divers. Il sollicite un appui financier sous forme de crédit. La réalisation de ce projet contribuera à son plein épanouissement et à celui de sa famille.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>132526</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

There is a strong bond between the women in the group both in business and in friendship.  The solidarity of their group is what makes them great candidates for a loan.  The money of the loan will go towards buying more goods to be sold in their individual businesses.  Each woman will receive the appropriate amount needed for her business and together they will work to pay back the loan.

Realizing that TYM Fund policy was very suitable for her family conditions, from the beginning, she borrowed 60 USD to breed pigs. By using husks wasted from the husking machine as pig mash, her breeding plan became more effective and expanded. Currently, she has 18 pigs (about 1000 kg) ready to be released with an intended profit of 2000 USD. Besides, she is investing in making ice-cream machines, and general store, etc. Therefore, her family income is very stable. Her wish is to borrow more money to expand her breeding plan and other businesses, increasing family income. This time she wants to borrow 950 USD to buy pig mash and unhusked rice. Mrs T. is living with her husband and 2 children in Yen Lac, Vinh Phuc. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Là một trong những thành viên trẻ của chi nhánh 15 nhưng chị Nguyễn Thị T., 33 tuổi, là người làm kinh tế giỏi. Nhận thức được lợi ích của Quỹ Tình thương là rất phù hợp với điều kiện gia đình nên ngay từ những ngày đầu chị T. đã vay 60USD đầu tư chăn nuôi lợn. Tận dụng cám bã từ việc làm máy xay xát, nấu rượu làm thức ăn chăn nuôi nên dự án chăn nuôi lợn ngày càng mang lại hiệu quả và được đầu tư lớn hơn. Hiện tại chị có 18 con lợn thịt (khoảng hơn 1 tấn) sắp cho xuất chuồng dự tính thu khoảng 2000USD. Ngoài ra chị còn đầu tư vào mở cửa hàng làm máy kem, bán hàng ...  nên thu nhập của gia đình rất tốt và ổn định. Mong muốn của chị T. là được vay những mức vốn lớn hơn để mở rộng dự án chăn nuôi - kinh doanh tăng thu nhập cho gia đình. Vòng vốn này chị xin vay 950USD để mua thức ăn gia súc vào gạo về xay xát. Chị T. hiện đang sống cùng chồng và hai con tại Yên Lạc, Vĩnh Phúc.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>132544</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Buy

She was one among the first 5 members of TYM Fund in the area. She also encouraged other people to join the Fund. Her early plan was to invest in breeding pigs and work on rice field. However, since there was policy allowing people to exchange the rice field for other-purpose land, she bravely invested money and effort in transforming the land into the fish ponds and orchards. Her family income from the fish ponds in 2007 was approximately 3000 USD. Currently, her family is working on 3 rice fields, 4 fish ponds. Therefore, she is very busy at this time. However, she still manages to find some spare time to join activities of the area. She is elected to be the head of her living area. Her husband is very sympathetic with her work and is a great help to her. Her business plan is going very well; therefore, she wants to borrow 950 USD to buy more fishes and food for them.   &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chị Đường Thị D., 52 tuổi, là một thành viên gương mẫu của cụm. Ngay từ những ngày đầu khi Quỹ về, chị là một trong 5 thành viên đầu tiên, ngoài ra chị còn tích cực vận động nhiều thành viên khác cùng tham gia. Dự án ban đầu chỉ đầu tư vào chăn nuôi lợn và làm ruộng nhưng từ khi hợp tác xã có chính sách dồn điền đổi thửa, gia đình chị đã mạnh dạn đầu tư tiền của, công sức cải tạo ruộng đào ao thả cá kết hợp trồng cây ăn quả. Thu nhập từ cá năm 2007 vừa qua khoảng 3000USD.  Hiện tại gia đình cấy 3 mẫu lúa, gần 4 mẫu ao thả cá, hàng ngày chị tập trung toàn bộ thời gian vào công việc nên rất tất bật. Mặc dù vậy chị vẫn dành thời gian cho việc đi sinh hoạt và các công việc chung của cụm được chị em tín nhiệm bầu làm cụm trưởng. Chồng chị rất hiểu và tạo mọi điều kiện để chị hoàn thành công việc chung. Dự án đang trên đà phát triển nên chị D. tiếp tục xin vay 950USD mua cá giống và thức ăn.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>132549</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farm

organization then decided to join. At that time, the family’s economy was in deep hardship. Her oldest son just got a construction job, and there was nothing else besides farming a little patch of rent rice paddy. For dwelling, they got a modest [i]three section[/i] hut. She took out loan to invest in her new business, trading vegetable and grain. With her income, income from her son’s construction job and together with a loan from her relatives, she is building their first house which costs 10,000USD. This time she is applying a loan of 950USD to buy more grain. The monthly family’s income is 22-USD.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Tháng 5 năm 2000, khi Quỹ Tình thương về xã Thanh Lâm, sau khi tìm hiểu, chị Hoàng Thị Tất, 49 tuổi, là một trong những thành viên đăng ký tham gia. Điều kiện gia đình chị lúc ấy thuộc diện khó khăn, con trai lớn mới đi làm, ngoài vài sào ruộng khoán ra chị cũng không biết làm gì thêm. Ngôi nhà 3 gian tạm bợ, tuềnh toàng tránh mưa nắng rất khổ cực. Sau khi tham gia vay vốn, chị Tất luôn sử dụng đúng mục đích và có hiệu quả, con trai lớn đi xây dựng cũng có ý thức tiết kiệm cho gia đình. Ngoài ra chị cũng có thêm nghề phụ là hàng ngày thu mua rau ngô bao tử đặt hàng cho khách hàng Hà nội. Sau bảy năm tham gia Quỹ với sự tự tin, cần cù, chịu khó, chị Tất đã tích lũy được một số vốn. Cộng với vốn vay họ hàng, chị đang xây dựng căn nhà mới rất khang trang trị giá hơn 10000USD. Khi chúng tôi đến hai vợ chồng chị niềm nở tiếp chúng tôi và không giấu được niềm vui mừng khi ngôi nhà mơ ước của anh chị đang được cất lên. Tâm sự của anh chị là tiếp tục gắn bó với Quỹ để xây dựng cuộc sống gia đình ngày càng ấm no, tốt đẹp hơn. Vòng vốn tới chị Tất xin vay 950USD để thu mua rau ngô bao tử. Thu nhập hàng tháng của gia đình là 220USD.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>132556</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits &amp;

When the agricultural expansion plan introduced to all provinces, Mrs. Giới has soon realized that that was a very rare opportunity. While other families might use their monies to build houses, she wisely used her money to invest in her farm. The investment brings her a handsome income. Currently she has a nice half acre farm which produces vegetable for the Hanoi’s markets. The product impresses the Office of Agricultural Encouragement of the Department of Agriculture and the office endorses it as an agricultural model for the province. Recently she invested 1,500USD to purchase 500 grapefruit trees for her current project. This time she is applying for a loan of 950USD to purchase more fruit trees and fertilizer.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Chị Hoàng Thị Giới, 38 tuổi, sống cùng chồng và 2 con đang trong độ tuổi đi học tại Mê Linh, Vĩnh Phúc. Khi việc xây khu công nghiệp phát triển tại các tỉnh, chị Giới đã sớm nắm bắt được điều kiện và cơ hội của gia đình mà không phải ai cũng có thể làm được. Trong khi nhiều gia đình đã dùng tiền đền bù xây dựng nhà cửa, mua sắm tiện nghi, thì chị Giới và chồng đã dùng đồng tiền đó vào việc cải tạo ruộng đất, dồn điền đổi thửa thành khu tập trung trồng trọt các loại rau sạch cung cấp cho thị trường. Số tiền đầu tư vào dự án cũng khá lớn và đang cho thu nhập cao. Hiện tại chị Giới có 7 sào vườn trồng các loại rau cung cấp cho thị trường Hà Nội và các vùng khác. Sản phẩm của gia đình chị được Phòng khuyến nông, sở nông nghiệp chọn làm dự án điển hình và nhân rộng ra toàn tỉnh. Mới đây chị Giới còn đầu tư 1500USD đầu tư mua 500 cây bưởi Diễn trồng quy hoạch theo mô hình trang trại, dự kiến sau vài ba năm sau sẽ cho thu nhập. Dự án lớn, dám nghĩ, dám làm và rất năng động đó là cảm nhận của người viết bài khi đến thăm mô hình của chị. Tương lai còn đang ở phía trước vẫn còn không ít những khó khăn, vất vả nhưng chị Giới luôn tin tưởng vào sự thành công của dự án. Vòng vốn này chị xin vay 950USD mua cây giống và phân bón.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>132559</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Buy

Same as other farmers in the area, life is harder when most of the farm land now converted to industrial plants. Seeing an opportunity in maize, she converted her little patch of rice daddy to a corn field. Besides her family’s production, she buys more maize from other family and delivers all to markets in Hanoi. In result, she has a little reputable business of trading maize. Though busy she still spends times with activities in the TYM Fund. This time she is applying a loan of 950USD to stock more maize. The average monthly income is 200USD.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Chị Nguyễn Thị Đạt, 38 tuổi, sống cùng chồng và 2 con tại Mê Linh, Vĩnh Phúc. Cũng như nhiều gia đình khác trong cụm, khi ruộng nương ngày càng ít đi nhường chỗ cho các nhà máy, xí nghiệp thì càng khó khăn cho chị và các gia đình làm nông nghiệp khác. Thấy thị trường đang có nhu cầu rau ngô bao tử, chị Đạt đã chuyển toàn bộ số đất nông nghiệp còn lại sang trồng rau ngô bao tử. Ngoài việc sản phẩm của gia đình, chị Đạt còn thu mua thêm của các gia đình khác và tiêu thụ ở thị trường Hà nội. Giờ đây gia đình chị đã trở thành điểm thu mua, tiêu thụ khá lớn và rất có uy tín. Công việc nhiều, chạy chợ suốt ngày nhưng chị Đạt vẫn dành thời gian tham gia đầy đủ vào các buổi họp và các hoạt động chung của Quỹ Tình thương. Vòng vốn tới chị Đạt tiếp tục vay 950USD để thu mua rau ngô bao tử của các gia đình trong vùng. Thu nhập bình quân của gia đình chị Đạt là 200USD.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>132562</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farm

In the city where she was born she used to sell chicha to help in her home. One she married, it was necessary to have income, so she opened a convenience store. She began little by little, with whatever she could buy to supply her store. So, with hard wrok, she was able to stock her store with a variety of products. She has since moved to a new locale, which was good for her, her family, and her business now is in its own locale and she doesn’t have to pay rent for a space. Now her store also has a bakery and small bazaar. She always has customers, and she has a dream with two her children of turning their great store in to a minimarket.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Desde muy pequeña Francisca aprendió lo concerniente a las ventas. En su pueblo natal ella solía vender chicha para ayudar en su hogar. Una vez que se casó, la necesidad de contar con un ingreso fue más grande, lo cual la convenció de abrir una bodega. &#13;&#10;Fue empezando poco a poco, con lo único que podía comprar para abastecer a su tienda. Así, con su empeño, logro que su tienda este bien surtida de diversos productos. Hasta que llego el momento de mudarse a vivir en otro lado. Lo que fue bueno para ella, para su familia y para su negocio también pues ahora contaba con un local propio y no debía pagar renta por uno alquilado. Ahora su bodega se ha complementado con una panadería y un pequeño bazar. Los clientes nunca le faltan, pero el sueño de ella y de sus dos hijos es convertir su gran bodega en un minimarket.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>132567</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

So she has approached CEPRODEL again to ask for a loan and therefore improve her business and support her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;El detalle de la actividad económica que se dedica la señora Amalia A. es a la venta de hot dogs y gaseosas en el mercado la Terminal de la ciudad de León. Su negocio inicia desde hace 8 años ambulante en el mercado hasta establecerse en su localidad.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Es madre soltera y con  un hijo a su cargo y además con la responsabilidad de mantener a su mamá que es una humilde anciana. Debido a  su situación económica que es muy baja, ha acudido a Ceprodel quien le ha beneficiado con créditos que le permiten la compra de los ingredientes para preparar sus deliciosos hot dog. Hoy en día su necesidad es la compra de estos productos tales como pan, salsa de tomate, cebollas, mostaza, crema y chorizo. Para esto acude una vez mas a CEPRODEL para obtener los créditos y así mejorar la situación de su negocio y familia.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>100</funded_amount><paid_amount>100</paid_amount><image><id>132571</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Buy condiments for hot dog business</use><location><country_code>NI</country_code><country>Nicaragua</country><town>Leon</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>12.435556 -86.879444</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>74</partner_id><posted_date>2008-02-24T17:50:12Z</posted_date><loan_amount>100</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Amalia Del Socorro</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-03-09T16:59:51Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>80</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>100</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-04-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>20</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-05-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>20</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-06-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>20</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>20</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>20</local_amount><processed_date>2008-04-09T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-09T09:13:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>178238</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>20</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-09T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-09T09:13:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>205642</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>20</local_amount><processed_date>2008-06-09T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-09T09:13:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>233083</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>20</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-09T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-09T09:13:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>262124</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-02-24T17:59:51Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-07-09T09:13:34Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>38028</id><name>Mujeres San Jardin De Jorge I Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;P&gt;The women of the community bank Mujeres Jardin de San Jorge arrive early for their meeting at the office of Friendship Bridge in Sololá, the region’s capital city, about a fifteen minute bus ride uphill from their town of San Jorge la Laguna. As they wait for the previous meeting to end, they greet each other with hugs and a chorus of ‘buenos dias’ and ‘como estas’, followed by excited chatter in their native language Kaqchiquel. As the other meeting lets out and the women begin to file in, the cream colored room becomes a canvas of brilliant colors, painted by the beautiful and intricate ‘huipiles’ (traditional woven blouses) that each woman wears.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;These huipiles are just one of many trades that the women practice. Among the eighteen, about half of them dedicate their time to weaving and sewing skirts (like the ones in the picture), scarves, purses, belts, ribbons that get woven into long braids, as well as huipiles. Ten of the 18 women are asking for a group loan of 26,000 quetzales ($3425), ranging from $150 to $400 per person, five of whom will invest in thread for their artisan business (one of them was not able to be present for the photo). Two women have jewelry businesses, making beaded bracelets, necklaces, rings and earrings that they sell in the nearby tourism capital Panajachel. Two women have small stores, selling soft drinks, snacks, chicken and sausages. And one woman, who could not be at the meeting because she was sick, has a tortillería, and will invest in the ingredients necessary for making corn and flour tortillas.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;The women of Mujeres Jardin have been with Friendship Bridge for two years, but have been together as a group much longer. They were previously with another institution, but were looking for a lower interest rate, which Friendship Bridge offers. They are more than happy with their new microfinance home, and are excited to see the long-term benefits for their business that less interest will bring. In addition to lower interest, one of their favorite things about Friendship Bridge is the education they receive—they are learning how to better run their business, care for their family, and have a real hope for the future (and they like that they get to play games while they learn, too!).</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>3425</funded_amount><paid_amount>3425</paid_amount><image><id>132572</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Weaving</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>These

She started her business 8 years ago with a capital of C$ 500 (five hundred córdobas net) that she had been saving since she was young.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mrs. P. had economic difficulties obtaining the products that she sells in the market from the beginning since she had to use the little money she made to buy groceries for her family and to pay her two children&apos;s school. It&apos;s important to highlight that she is a single mother, but that has not stopped her from getting loans from Ceprodel. These loans have helped her to improve her economic situation and to keep her modest home. She has obtained 13 previous loans with Ceprodel.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Veronica MR, Kiva volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;div align=&apos;justify&apos;&gt; &#13;&#10;El negocio al que se dedica la señora Ana P. es a la venta de cosméticos personales (colas, collares, pulseras, cartera) en el mercado la Terminal del departamento de León en Nicaragua.

Four of these women will invest in colorful threads to weave and sew. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;One woman has a jewelry business, selling beaded bracelets, necklaces and earrings in the nearby tourist capital, Panajachel. In addition to purchasing materials, she plans to hire an employee to increase her production. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The other three women (one who could not be in the picture) have small ‘tiendas’, stores, where they sell soft drinks, snacks, chicken and sausages. These women have a goal of opening additional stores, where they will offer an expanded variety of products, ranging from food to basic commodity products. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;All these women have children, sometimes as many as eight each and they dream of being able to better provide for their families. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With a lower interest rate, they are able to invest in more materials, therefore producing more and earning a higher income. With this added income, the women are able to provide better education for their children as they can purchase the books, clothing and supplies they need. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;All of them whish that their children will finish school and become professionals so that they don’t have to struggle in the same ways they have had

However, she noticed that her business was not able to support her family and her four small children. And so, with the hope of progressing little by little, she asked for a loan from Ceprodel, who offered her a friendly hand and helped her to push forward the success of her small business. Today, she has been able to develop her business, making a little bit more money, which is used to buy more products. But, she finds herself in a difficult position where she needs to ask for another loan in order to stock her fruits and vegetables, the larger quantity of products will mean more revenue and better support for her family. &lt;p&gt;Translated from Spanish to English by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;div align=&apos;justify&apos;&gt; &#13;&#10;La  Señora Maria Elena P. se  dedica  a  la actividad  de  venta de frutas y verduras desde hace 23  años ubicada en el mercado La Terminal en León.

The loan officer begins, and all eyes are on her. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mujeres Chuisequéc have been together for two years now. They began with three women and are now up to eighteen. The word spread quickly about the loans from Friendship Bridge and how they helped business, and the eighteen women in the room are eager and hopeful, ready to put their loans to good use. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;All but two of them have small farms in which they grow potatoes, carrots, onions, radishes, beans, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, lemongrass, and chamomile. The farms are located in Concepción, an area with a temperate climate and a rich soil that allows for year-round farming. Ten of the women are asking for a group loan of 21,500 quetzales ($2825), ranging from $150 to $400, all which will be invested in farming. They will use the money to purchase seeds and fertilizer. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The women of Mujeres Chuisequéc have large families- up to ten kids each. As they go to sign their names, all but two of them sign with a thumbprint, indicating they cannot write. The women express that everything they do is for their children. They work hard every day and do everything possible to provide for their families so that their children can receive an education and have lives with more opportunities and far less suffering than what they have had to endure.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2825</funded_amount><paid_amount>2825</paid_amount><image><id>132586</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Her vision of the city expansion has encouraged her to open a gas station. Due to her lack of experience the start up failed. She and her husband tried again with a different project, a plastic recycle plant. She has a better luck this time. The operation is steady together with good income. Currently her plant has around 10 employees. The production is sold to bigger plants in Hanoi, Hưng Yên and some other provinces. The business keeps expanding and gains good reputation. This time she is applying for a loA. of 1,200USD to stock more scrap plastic. The plant needs more capital that is why she hopes she cA. be approved for bigger loans, 5,000-6,000USD. The monthly income is 500-550USD. She has 3 school age children.     &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Là một trong rất ít thành viên trẻ nhưng năng động và mạnh dạn đầu tư dự án lớn, tận dụng lợi thế và điều kiện thuận lợi như đất đai rộng, gần đường giao thông, bA. đầu chị Tạ Thị Phương A., 30 tuổi, đầu tư mở cửa hàng Gas nhưng do thiếu kinh nghiệm, đồng vốn nhỏ hẹp nên việc kinh doanh bị thua lỗ phải bỏ dở. Vốn là người dám nghĩ dám làm, không chịu chấp nhận thất bại, chị A. cùng chồng lại tìm kiếm và học hỏi nhiều kinh nghiệm ở nhiều nơi với nhiều nghề khác nhau. Được một người bạn mách nước, chị Thanh và chồng cùng góp vốn với anh trai mở xưởng sản xuất nhựa nguyên liệu. Sau một thời giA., công việc đi vào ổn định và cho thu nhập tốt. Hiện tại xưởng của gia đình chị đang có gần chục công nhân đang trực tiếp sản xuất. Sản phẩm nhựa nguyên liệu của gia đình làm ra được cung cấp cho các nhà máy sản xuất nhựa ở Hà Nội, Hưng Yên và một số tỉnh khác được khách hàng rất tin cậy nên công việc ngày càng phát triển. Vòng vốn này chị A. xin vay 1200USD để thu mua nhựa về tái chế. Nhu cầu sử dụng vốn của chị A. rất lớn nên nguyện vọng của chị cùng gia đình là Quỹ cho vay mức vốn lớn hơn (khoảng 5000-6000USD) để tiếp tục đầu tư mở rộng dự án. Thu nhập của chị A. là 500-550USD/tháng. Chị có 3 con còn nhỏ đang trong độ tuổi đi học.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>132594</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Waste

Bridge office, their strong faces colored by the wind and the sun they daily endure as they take care of their farms. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;They have traveled an hour from their community of Concepción, where the soil is rich and the climate good, allowing for year-round farming. All but two of the eighteen women have small farms, where they grow potatoes, carrots, onions, radishes, beans, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, lemongrass, and chamomile (quite a variety!). &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;They whisper to each other in their native language Kaqchiquel, eagerly awaiting approval of the loans they have requested. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Eight of the women are asking for a group loan of 18,500 quetzales ($2425), ranging from $150 to $400 each. Of the eight, six will invest in seeds and fertilizer for their farms. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;One woman is an artisan, weaving beautiful ‘huipiles’, traditional Mayan blouses known for their intricate and colorful designs. She will invest in thread for her weavings. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Another woman is a ‘comerciante’ (commerce women), buying a variety of goods in bulk and selling them at local markets. With her loan, she will buy a greater quantity of each item, lowering the price per item and increasing her profits. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Each woman of Mujeres Chuisequéc has a family to take care of; some even have up to ten children. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;They express that everything they do is to improve the lives of their children so they can receive an education and learn to read and write. This will open them new opportunities and avoid them the suffering their mothers have had to endure. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;As they go to sign their names, all but two sign with a thumbprint, indicating they cannot write. But they sign with pride, knowing that with this loan they are doing everything in their power to give their children the right tools to learn and later on sign their names with a pen.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2425</funded_amount><paid_amount>2425</paid_amount><image><id>132595</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

She joins the TYM Fund in 2001 when her S. was 8 months old. The funds of her first loan was invested in wedding parties such as china, utensils and decorative items for her rental business. Though the income was hefty in wedding seaS., off seaS. had different story. In 2006, she converts her rental business to a refreshment distributor which serves fruits and refreshment to general population and also other businesses as well. This business gives a more stable monthly income of 300USD. She is applying a loan of 1200USD to stock more goods.     &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chị Kiều Thị Sơn, 27 tuổi, sống cùng chồng và 1 con trai 6 tuổi tại Sóc Sơn. Chị Sơn bắt đầu tham gia Quỹ từ năm 2001, sau khi sinh con được 8 tháng. Số vốn vay lần đầu được chị Sơn đầu tư mua phông bạt, bát đĩa cho thuê đám cưới. Mỗi lần cho thuê mang lại cho chị lợi nhuận vài chục USD. Thu nhập bình quân cũng khá nhưng vào những tháng không phải trong mùa cưới thường không có việc. Năm 2006 chị Sơn chuyển sang buôn bán bánh kẹo, hoa quả, nước giải khát phục vụ nhu cầu tiêu dùng của người dân trong địa phương và bán buôn cho các cửa hàng trong huyện. Do đã hoạt động kinh doanh phục vụ đám cưới từ thời gian trước nên cửa hàng của chị được rất nhiều người biết đến. Thu nhập bình quân của cửa hàng đạt 300USD/tháng. Với khả năng phát triển của cửa hàng nên vòng vốn này chị Sơn tiếp tục xin vay 1200USD mua bánh kẹo, rượu bia.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>132597</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

I Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;P&gt;Seated on plastic chairs, wooden boards, or the ground, the women of the community bank Kaksija gather in the home of one of the members, talking in their native language K´iche´, treating each other like family after almost eight years of being together as a group.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Waiting for the meeting to begin, some women nurse their babies, others work on craft projects, and others catch up on the weekly news.  The fourteen women of the group dedicate themselves to artisan crafts, primarily to ‘huipiles’, a traditional Mayan blouse woven with intricate patterns.  They also specialize in other typical clothing, such as the skirts you see in the photo. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;The women of Kaksija are strong and wise.  Most have been practicing their trade since their childhood, and have perfected the art.  They sell their clothing in nearby markets, but are now looking for ways to expand their business.  They would like to break into the tourist market surrounding Lake Atitlan, about an hour and a half away. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Eight of the women are asking for a group loan of 17,500 quetzales ($2300), ranging from $150 to $400 per person, with which they will purchase thread for weaving, and two of these women are hoping to also invest in a sewing machine, in hopes to increase production as well as quality of their sewing. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;All eight of the women have children, with some of the older women having as many as ten. They dream of expanding their business in order to better provide for their kids, so that they can receive an education and have more opportunity in their lives.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2300</funded_amount><paid_amount>2300</paid_amount><image><id>132600</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Weaving</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>To

She joins the TYM Fund in 1994. The funds of her first loan was invested in a food stand which serves inexpensive breakfast items. She was young and energetic. Her house situates right at Rout 133, near by the headquarter of the Air Force division and other government offices. From a small breakfast stand, she expands it to a full-fledged restaurant, Phúc-Giá. The restaurant has three employees with monthly salary of 50USD each. Her monthly income is 350USD. She is applying for a loan of 1,200USD to stock more goods. She hope she can be approved with her next loan of 3,000USD, &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chị Nguyễn Thị Giá, 39 tuổi, sống tại Sóc Sơn là thành viên tham G. Quỹ năm 1994. Vốn vay vòng 1 được chị đầu tư bán hàng ăn sáng với những món ăn ngon miệng, rẻ tiền, đặc trưng của vùng nông thôn Việt Nam như xôi đỗ, cháo gà, bánh nếp, bánh rán ... Mặc dù còn trẻ nhưng chị Giá là một phụ nữ năng động tháo vát, nhà lại ngay mặt đường 131, cạnh sư đoàn không quân và các cơ quan, thuận tiện giao thông, nên chị bàn với anh sửa chữa nâng cấp nhà mở rộng kinh doanh hàng ăn. Với cái rét thấu người duới 10 độ, nếu bạn có thời gian và muốn làm ấm lòng mình để bù đắp năng lượng tiêu hao xin mời đến với nhà hàng Phúc-Giá với món khoái khẩu lẩu lòng bò-gà. Hiện tại chị Giá thuê 3 người giúp việc với mức lương tháng 50USD. Với thu nhập 350USD/tháng của cửa hàng, vòng vốn này chị Giá xin vay 1200USD để mua thực phẩm, đồ uống thu hút thêm ngày càng đông khách. Trong tương lai, dự định của chị là muốn vay thêm 3000USD đầu tư nhà hàng tại một địa điểm khác.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>132602</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Buy

Though busy, she always whole heartedly participates in the Fund’s activities and helps other members. She lives with her husband and two children in Quang Tiến, Sóc Sơn.

Vòng vốn đầu chị vay của Quỹ 125USD đầu tư vào cửa hàng cắt tóc gội đầu. Bản thân là một người có tay nghề và nhiệt tình với công việc nên khách đến cửa hàng ngày một đông. Kinh tế phát triển, năm 2006 chị Phương học thêm nghề trang điểm cô dâu và cho thuê áo cưới, chụp ảnh. Khách hàng của chị là những đôi lứa yêu nhau và những cặp chuẩn bị cưới. Thu nhập bình quân một tháng của cửa hàng đạt 450USD. Mặc dù rất bận rộn với công việc nhưng trong thời gian tham gia Quỹ chị Phương luôn hoàn thành tốt trách nhiệm của mình, và sẵn sàng giúp đỡ chị em trong cụm khi gặp khó khăn. Hiện tại chị Phương đang sống cùng chồng và 2 con tại Quang Tiến, Sóc Sơn. Vòng vốn này chị xin vay 1200USD mua áo cưới và mỹ phẩm.</vi></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>132604</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Beauty

Ii Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Dressed in traditional Mayan clothing with babies wrapped in blankets on their back, the women of the community bank Kaksija enter one by one into the home of one of the members, where they gather for their monthly meeting.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;They speak rapidly in their native language of K´iche´, and when necessary, the younger members translate from Spanish for the older members of the group.  These fourteen women know each other well, having been together for almost eight years.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;They dedicate themselves to traditional artisan crafts, primarily to the intricate art of weaving ‘huipiles’, beautiful hand-woven blouses than can take up to a month to produce.  They also sew skirts and scarves, such as the ones in the picture.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;As members of their community bank, these women have not only become friends and confidants, but they also support each other in business and give advice on loans.  If a new member enters the group, the other women make sure that she understands what it means to receive a loan, and the importance of paying back on time.  They help each other, sharing business tips and loan advice, ensuring that each member is successful.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Six women of the community bank are asking for a group loan of 16,000 quetzales ($2100), ranging from $150 to $400 per person.  They will invest this money in colorful thread for their weaving and one woman is hoping to purchase a sewing machine that will enable her to rapidly increase her productivity, as well as the quality of her product.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;All the women have children and they dream of being able to provide them an education so they can have better lives with more opportunities.

No obstante, en un tiempo tuvo la oportunidad de vender ella misma huevos, ya que los tenía en grandes cantidades. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Poco a poco fue incluyendo a sus ventas los pollos que ella criaba. Hasta que se dedico por completo a la venta de pollos y dejo de lado la crianza de ellos. Solo por temporadas vuelve a la crianza, como en Navidad que lo hace porque recibe pedidos de algunos clientes. Gracias a su negocio, a la ayuda de su esposo y a la fuerza que nunca la abandona, ella ha podido mantener a sus hijos y darles educación. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Isabel acaba de cumplir setenta años y

Santa Catarina Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;P&gt;In a modest room lit only by the sun, a woman sweeps the dirt floor and sets out multi-colored plastic chairs in preparation for the ‘desembolsa’, the meeting for the community bank Nueva Santa Catarina where its 11 members will have their requested loans approved.  The women gather excitedly, talking rapidly in their native language K´iche´, while their children play in the folds of their dresses, giggling timidly.  These women are strong and have endured much, yet more than exhaustion they emit hope and joy.  As a community bank, they are proud to have been together eight years, their bank was the first of the now four banks in their small community.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Located about an hour and a half from the region’s capital, Sololá, the 11 women dedicate themselves to the beautiful and intricate art of weaving huipiles, native Mayan blouses.  A single huipil can take up to one month to make, and after an investment of about 200 Quetzales (about $25), they can sell it for about 500 Quetzales (about $60).  Currently, the women sell their huipiles in the nearby town of Nahuala, and they are well known in their community so customers also come directly to their home to make purchases.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Of the 11 women, almost half can read and write, which is a very large percentage for the area.  They are smart in business, and are looking for new ways to expand.  They’ve recognized the large number of sales that tourism brings in, and are hoping to implement an export business or connect with a nearby community where tourism is more prevalent than in their town and open a market there.   As a group they are asking for a loan of 33,500 Quetzales, about $4400, $400 per person, which they will invest in various colored threads to weave their huipiles.  A few of the women are also planning on using part of their loan to hire extra help so they can increase the rate of production and make more sales.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>4400</funded_amount><paid_amount>4400</paid_amount><image><id>132623</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Weaving</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>To

His profession has allowed him to make a living for his family. He covers weddings, birthdays, baptisms and graduations, among other events. He has a good number of clients that hire him on a temporary basis, but he is always on the outlook to make new clients and to cover important business events. Because of their tough financial situation and the high living costs, his wife sells cosmetics by catalog in workplaces and to family and friends. In this way, they support their two children. Having prioritized other expenses, they haven’t been able to repair the roof of their house living room, which is cracked and has holes, after many years of use. Moreover, some of the zinc sheets are loose due to the strong winds and Mr. Walter is afraid that might facilitate thieves breaking into his house. He is requesting a loan to tend to this urgent need of changing the roof. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Don Walter es fotógrafo de profesión, con 12 años en esta actividad,que le ha permitido sacar adelante a su familia. El señor cubre bodas, cumpleaños, bautizos y graduaciones, entre otros eventos. Cuenta con un buen número de clientes que lo contratan temporalmente, pero siempre está en busca de capturar nuevos clientes y  cubrir eventos importantes en empresas. Viendo que la situación económica se encuentra difícil y lo cara que está la vida, la esposa se dedica a ofrecer cosméticos en centros de trabajo, a familiares y amistades. De este modo mantienen a sus dos hijos. Por priorizar otros gastos, no han podido cambiar el techo de la sala de la vivienda, el cual se encuentra rajado y con orificios debido a los años de uso, y hay ciertas láminas de zinc que están flojas debido a los fuertes vientos, por lo cual teme que se le metan a despojarlo de sus pertenecias. Siendo esta una necesidad urgente, el señor solicita un préstamo para cambiar el techo.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>132627</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Photography</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Purchase

As time went on, the sale of clothing she herself made was no longer enough to support her family. For that reason, in 1983, she decided to open a general store. Things were going well, but lack of time forced her to close the business since she needed to take care of her younger children. Because of this she continued making clothing and worked in whatever other business appeared at the time, such as the sale of fish, sale of food, etc.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Three years ago, one of her daughters suggested that she reopen the store. Since she had continued to pay the yearly business license fee to her city, it was no problem to reopen. Because of this, thanks to her daughter´s support and a loan from EDAPROSPRO, she able to open the store again.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With a lot of effort, Genera gets ahead in her business. Fortunately her children are grown now and help her once in a while. However, she thinks about growing the business even more because now she needs to take care of two illnesses which she suffers from, diabetes and osteoporosis.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Con el divorcio de su esposo, hace treinta y cuatro años, Genara, de pronto, se vio con la responsabilidad de cuidar a sus cinco hijos ella sola. Conforme pasaba  el tiempo, la venta de ropa que ella misma confeccionaba no era suficiente para mantener a su hogar. Por ello, en el año 1983 decidió abrir una bodega. Todo iba yendo bien, pero la falta de tiempo la obligo a cerrar el negocio, pues debía ocuparse de atender a sus hijos menores aún. Así que continúo con la confección de ropas y alguno que otro negocio que se le presentaba en el momento, como la venta de pescados, venta de comidas, etc. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Hace tres años, una de sus hijas le propuso volver a abrir la tienda. Ya que ella continuaba pagando año tras año el permiso que la municipalidad le había otorgado de tener un negocio en su casa, no fue un problema reinaugurarla. Fue así que, gracias al apoyo de su hija y al préstamo que le brindo EDAPROSPO pudo volver a abrir su bodega.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Actualmente, Genara lleva con mucho esfuerzo su negocio adelante, felizmente sus hijos ya están grandes y la ayudan de vez en cuando. Sin embargo, ella piensa en hacer crecer su negocio aun más porque ahora debe encargarse de las dos enfermedades que la molestan, diabetes y osteoporosis.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>132629</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

He is the father of two small children who along with his wife, a homemaker, make every effort to bring them forth successfully and educate them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Currently, Vicente’s necessity lies in that there is no electric power in his town, for which reason he acquired a solar panel and must now repay this loan. Because of this circumstance, he turns to Ceprodel to request a loan with the objective of paying this debt, which will allow him to have electricity in his home so that his children can study in the afternoons and in the evening and so they have access to a small television. In this way, it will be possible that he and his family can improve their quality of living.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Evelyn Garcia, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;div align=&apos;justify&apos;&gt; &#13;&#10;El caballero Vicente López durante toda su vida se ha dedicado a la agricultura por vivir en una zona rural como lo es el municipio de Achuapa en León.

Throughout her life, she worked in agriculture and cattle raising. Being a woman of amazing strength, she has worked hard to support her household and cover all of her needs. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Achuapa is located is very far from the city, and is a rural town without electricity. Facing this problem, Georgina uses candles at night, but she has been working towards installing solar panels to power her house. However, each installation requires a deposit beforehand, and for this reason she is turning to Ceprodel for a loan to cover this deposit and better her living conditions. Half a solar panel can power two 50-Watt lamps and a small television. Please help with her investment in house repair so she may provide better living conditions for her children. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Translated by Lily Fu, Princeton University Language Project.&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/div&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;div align=&apos;justify&apos;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Georgina S. es una dama originaria del municipio de Achuapa en la ciudad de León. Durante toda su vida se ha dedicado al trabajo de la agricultura y ganadería siendo una dama muy esforzada que a diario lucha por mantener su hogar y suplir todas las necesidades.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;El municipio de Achuapa es una localidad muy alejada de la ciudad y se caracteriza por ser una zona rural que no posee energía eléctrica. Ante este problema, la señora Georgina hace uso de candiles por la noche pero al ver que esta problemática puede erradicarse, solicita un panel solar para su hogar. Una vez instalado el panel su obligación como persona responsable es pagar esta deuda y es por esta razón que acude a Ceprodel solicitando préstamo para cubrir la deuda y mejorar la condición de su hogar de habitación. Por medio del panel solar tiene derecho a dos lámparas de 50 Watts y un pequeño televisor. Su anhelo es ir invirtiendo en las necesidades de su hogar para darle lo mejor a sus hijos.&#13;&#10;&lt;/div&gt;</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>132656</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

Del Socorro</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>Farming is exhausting work, exposed to the sun and worn out from the effort it requires.  Aware of this, Mileidy has earned a living farming for more than 10 years in the &quot;municipio&quot; of Achuapa near the Nicaraguan city of Leon.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mileidy is a very hard-working person who thanks to the great sacrifices she&apos;s made has managed to improve her house, lacking only an investment in electric lighting, having only had lanterns for night lighting up to now.  To meet this need, she&apos;s asking that a solar panel be installed at her house.  She&apos;s looking for a loan from Ceprodel to get the money she needs to cover the debt and gain the benefits of being able to light her house at night.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;El trabajo de agricultura requiere de mucho esfuerzo  por la exposición al sol y el desgaste físico que este trabajo provoca. Consiente de esto la señora Mileidy C. se dedica a este negocio desde hace mas de 10 años en el municipio de Achuapa en la ciudad  de León en Nicaragua.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mileidy se caracteriza por ser una persona muy trabajadora que gracias a los grandes sacrificios que ha realizado ha logrado mejorar su casa de habitación faltándole solamente invertir en la iluminación ya que lo hace con candiles por la noche. Para suplir esta necesidad, solicita que le implementen un panel solar en su hogar y al obtenerlo se ve en la obligación de pagar este panel. Es por tal razón que busca créditos en Ceprodel para obtener el dinero necesario para cubrir esta deuda y de esta manera continuar esforzándose grandemente y sacarle mas provecho a los días por medios de las actividades que le permite realizar la energía eléctrica por medio del panel solar.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>132657</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

He makes a living farming and raising livestock.  He&apos;s originally from the &quot;municipio&quot; of Achuapa near the city of Leon in the beautiful country of Nicaragua.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Pablo does the hard work that he has to do everyday to provide his children with the most that he can and one of his greatest hopes is that they end up with professional careers.  With that goal in mind, he has invested his few resources in the basic needs of his children and he now wants to address their lack of electric power, a problem for those who live in this rural area.  He&apos;s bought a solar panel that he wants to pay off as quickly as possible.  Very wisely, he&apos;s approached Ceprodel for a loan that will allow him to repay the [original?] debt and be certain of not owing it so that he can begin to use the panel for his own benefit and that of his children and beloved wife.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Pablo Calderón es un padre de seis hijos unos menores de edad y otros en la edad de la adolescencia pero todos dependientes de él. Su negocio desde pequeño ha sido en el campo con la agricultura y ganadería. Es originario del municipio Achuapa ubicado en la ciudad de León de la bella nación de Nicaragua.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;El arduo trabajo que a diario lleva a cabo lo realiza con el propósito de brindarle lo mejor a sus hijos y uno de sus mejores anhelos es que ellos lleguen a ser profesionales de éxito. Para lograr esta meta ha invertido sus pocos recursos en las necesidades de sus hijos pero hoy en día debe suplir la necesidad de ausencia de energía eléctrica ya que habitan en una zona rural. Para esto ha adquirido un panel solar que debe de pagar lo mas pronto posible. Muy sabiamente ha acudido a Ceprodel para obtener un crédito que le permita salir de esta deuda y tener la certeza de que no debe este bien y así comenzar a usarlo sin ningun problema para beneficio directo de él , sus hijos y su querida esposa.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>132658</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

the Nicaraguan city of Leon.  He&apos;s a married men with four children who study at a small school that they have to walk very far to reach.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The problem that Vicente faces is that there&apos;s no electricity in his neighborhood because it&apos;s a rural area with few basic services.  He&apos;s looking for a way to solve the problem and he&apos;s applying to Ceprodel for a loan that will allow him [to withdraw from this debt for a solar panel?] so that he can use the power from it for household chores and provide light for his children to study.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Vicente López por mas de 10 años se ha dedicado al negocio de agropecuario en la ciudad de León específicamente en la comunidad de Achuapa que es el lugar donde se ha criado desde pequeño. Es un caballero casado y con cuatro hijos estudiando en una pequilla escuela que a diario tienen que caminar una larga distancia para llegar a ella.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Una problemática atravesada por el señor Vicente es la ausencia de energía eléctrica en su localidad por ser una zona rural que no cuenta con estos servicios básicos. Por este motivo, el señor Vicente busca la manera de solucionar este problema y para ello acude a Ceprodel para que le brinde crédito que le permita salir de esta deuda y así aprovechar la energía tanto para los quehaceres del hogar como para que sus hijos estudien sin ningún problema.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>132660</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

A friend invited her to a perfume testing at her home, and that’s what she started selling first. As the business prospered, in 2000 she incorporated cosmetics of renowned brands, as well as naturistic products. To date, she has been able to maintain the business, with lows and highs. The income has allowed her to pay for the education of her three children, who she wishes to eventually send to college.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Angelina wishes to buy more merchandise in order to offer new products to her clients. For this reason she is requesting a $850 loan, that she is willing to repay in five months. With your help Angelina and her family will make it.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;En enero de 1996, Angelina comenzó a vender cosméticos, perfumes y artículos para el hogar, gracias a una amiga que la invitó a su casa a una demostración de perfumes, y esto fue lo primero que empezó a vender. Como le empezó a ir bien, en el año 2000 incorporó también cosméticos de reconocidas marcas, además de productos naturistas. Hasta la fecha ha mantenido este negocio con altas y bajas. Sin embargo el dinero que gana le sirve para poder pagar los estudios de sus tres hijos, a quienes desea brindarles la oportunidad de estudiar una carrera universitaria. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Angelina desea comprar más mercancía para poder ofrecer nuevos productos a sus clientes. Es por eso que está solicitando un crédito de US$ 850 que está dispuesta a pagar en un plazo de 5 meses. Con tu ayuda Angelina y su familia podrán salir adelante.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>132702</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cosmetics Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Purchase of merchandise.</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Tampico, Tamaulipas</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>22.216667 -97.85</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2008-02-28T02:40:11Z</posted_date><loan_amount>850</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Angelina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-03-14T02:02:10Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>MXN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>9000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>850</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-04-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1800</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-05-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1800</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-06-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1800</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1800</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1800</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>1800</local_amount><processed_date>2008-04-12T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-12T09:03:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1836.94</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>180286</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>1800</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-12T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-12T09:03:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1836.94</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>207873</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>1800</local_amount><processed_date>2008-06-12T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-12T09:03:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1836.94</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>235820</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>1800</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-12T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-12T09:03:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1836.94</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>264670</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>1800</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-12T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-12T09:03:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1836.92</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>293611</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-02-29T03:02:10Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-08-12T09:03:00Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>38088</id><name>Cruzkaya&apos;s Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Cruzkaya, Francisca, and Tarcila have been members of the community bank “Minka” for between two and four years.

She travels to Lima twice per month to buy products that she then sells in Ayacucho.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;When the group was asked what their dreams for the future were, it was Tarcila’s answer that stood out.  First she said she wanted to own a home so that she would have something to leave her children.  She began to cry when she confessed that she had recently found out she had a possibly fatal illness that doctors could not cure.  The other two associates comforted her by telling her hopeful stories about their own experiences with illness.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Cruzkaya, Francisca, and Tarcila need loans of 600, 600, and 400 soles (3 soles = $1), which they will use to buy artisan products, fabric, thread, zippers, elastic, and used clothing.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>575</funded_amount><paid_amount>575</paid_amount><image><id>132704</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Market</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Cruzkaya, Francisca, and Tarcila need loans of 600, 600, and 400 soles (3 soles = $1), which they will use to buy artisan products, fabric, thread, zippers, elastic, and used clothing.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Ayacucho</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-13.158333 -74.223889</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>70</partner_id><posted_date>2008-02-25T18:40:24Z</posted_date><loan_amount>575</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Cruzkaya</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Francisca Carmen</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Eugenia A Tarcila</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-03-11T12:54:08Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1600</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>575</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-04-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-05-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-06-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>143.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>143.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>143.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>143.75</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>144</amount><local_amount>400.7</local_amount><processed_date>2008-04-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-11T09:11:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>414.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>179967</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>144</amount><local_amount>400.7</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-11T09:11:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>414.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>207545</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>144</amount><local_amount>400.7</local_amount><processed_date>2008-06-11T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-11T09:11:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>414.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>235431</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>143</amount><local_amount>397.91</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-11T09:11:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>411.87</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>264191</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-02-26T13:54:08Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-07-11T09:11:32Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>38089</id><name>Edith</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Edith M.

This young woman, eager to start her own business, decided to start a family business with her sister, using the capital they were able to accrue by saving part of their salaries. The sisters identified the opportunity of opening an Internet café at their mother’s house, as there were no other competitor businesses in the area. They have run the business for three years and they offer a variety of services, which have diversified as their clientele grows. The small business has five web access computers, a photocopier and two phone cabins for international and local calls. In order to increase their income, they plan to acquire a greater number of computers, a spiral binding machine and a scanner. But Zligian’s priority at present is to renovate and repaint the store, in order to improve its appearance. The income from the business has allowed this family to improve their living conditions.

Esta joven deseosa de iniciar su propio negocio decide junto a su hermana de 21 años emprender un negocio familiar, con capital propio, ya que siempre han ahorrado parte de los ingresos que percibían de su trabajo. Las hermanas vieron la necesidad de montar un Cyber Café en la vivienda de su madre, ya que en esa zona no existe ningún Cyber que le pueda generar competencia. El negocio ya tiene tres años de existencia, y ofrece una variedad de servicios, los cuales se han ido diversificando a medida que va aumentando el número de clientes. El negocio es pequeño y cuenta con cinco computadoras con servicio de Internet, una fotocopiadora y dos cabinas para realizar llamadas nacionales e internacionales. Las expectativas de estas jóvenes son las de adquirir un mayor número de máquinas, comprar una encolochadora y un escáner, de modo de aumentar sus ganancias. La prioridad de Zligian en estos momentos es la remodelar las paredes del local y pintarlo, dando así una mejor presentación al negocio. Los ingresos del negocio le han permitido a esta familia mejorar su nivel de vida y vivir en condiciones dignas. Las hermanas se sienten satisfechas con lo que juntas han logrado, a pesar de su corta edad.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>225</funded_amount><paid_amount>225</paid_amount><image><id>132710</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Computers</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Purchase of cement, sand, iron, stone and paint.</use><location><country_code>NI</country_code><country>Nicaragua</country><town>Managua</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>12.150833 -86.268333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>98</partner_id><posted_date>2008-03-04T21:40:14Z</posted_date><loan_amount>225</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Zilghian Julisa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-03-18T22:40:07Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>NIO</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>4160</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>225</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-04-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>693.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-05-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>693.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-06-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>693.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>693.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>693.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>693.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>702.58</local_amount><processed_date>2008-04-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-28T19:45:47Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>718.22</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>186713</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>702.58</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-28T19:47:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>718.22</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>214676</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>702.58</local_amount><processed_date>2008-06-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-28T19:49:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>718.22</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>242821</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>702.58</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-28T19:52:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>718.22</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>271882</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>702.58</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-28T19:56:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>718.22</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>301137</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>35</amount><local_amount>647.11</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-02T17:23:56Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-09T01:39:29Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>661.52</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>314501</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-03-04T23:40:07Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-09-09T01:39:29Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>38091</id><name>Diana Aurora</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>Diana began selling perfumes in February 2003.

She now has three children, two of whom still live with her.  She lives in the Human Victor Raul settlement in the Peruvian &quot;departamento&quot; of La Libertad.  She raises farm animals such as ducks and chickens and fattens them for sale in the nearby Santa Rosa market.  Sometimes she gets larger orders for holidays such as Mother&apos;s Day, Christmas, national holidays, etc.  In addition to that, she works as a street vendor, buying carnations and roses from a wholesaler in the La Hermelinda market and selling them in other local markets, and grows pineapples and avocados on a small piece of land she inherited in the &quot;distrito&quot; of Poroto that she harvests approximately every three months and also sells.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Thanks to some neighbors, she joined the Mujeres del Milenium (&quot;Women of the Millenium&quot;) community bank where she received her first loan of S/.300 (300 Peruvian soles or about US$100).  With the money, she bought feed for her animals.  With this loan of S/.1000, to be repaid in 4 months, she will buy eight sacks of processed feed, 30 dozen roses and 30 dozen carnations.  Santos Elena dream of buying a stand in the market and setting up a flower shop.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;La señora Santos Elena A. M. tiene 45 años de edad, estudió secundaria completa. Tiene tres hijos en total pero sólo dos dependen de ella.  Vive en el Asentamiento Humano Víctor Raúl, distrito de El Porvenir, provincia de Trujillo, departamento de La Libertad.  Su negocio consiste en la crianza de animales menores tales como patos, pollos y gallinas, a los cuales engorda para venderlos en el mercado “Santa Rosa” ubicado en el distrito en el que vive. A veces le hacen pedidos al por mayor en fechas especiales como día de la madre, navidad, fiestas patrias, etc., además en el mercado “La Hermelinda” compra variedad de flores, claveles y rosas al por mayor para volver a vender en condición de ambulante por distintos mercados de la ciudad. En un pequeño terreno que heredó en el distrito de Poroto ha sembrado algunas plantas como piñas y paltas que cosecha cada tres meses aproximadamente, productos que también trae a vender en los mercados. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Gracias a unas vecinas ingresó al Banco Comunal “Mujeres del Milenium”, lugar donde obtuvo su primer préstamo de S/. 300, con este dinero compró el alimento para sus animales: concentrado y maíz.  Con el préstamo de S/. 1,000, el cual pagará en cuatro meses, comprará ocho sacos de concentrado, 30 docenas de rosas y 30 docenas de claveles.  La señora Elena sueña con comprar un puesto en el mercado e implementar una florería.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>132722</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Animal Sales</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Buy animal feed for livestock business and flowers for resale.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>El Porvenir - Trujillo</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>-10 -76</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>72</partner_id><posted_date>2008-03-04T20:20:20Z</posted_date><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Santos Elena</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-03-19T00:05:21Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-04-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-05-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-06-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>88</amount><local_amount>251.43</local_amount><processed_date>2008-04-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-19T09:14:48Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>253.46</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>186590</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>88</amount><local_amount>251.43</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-19T09:14:48Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>253.46</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>214531</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>88</amount><local_amount>251.43</local_amount><processed_date>2008-06-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-19T09:14:48Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>253.46</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>242653</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>86</amount><local_amount>245.71</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-07-19T09:14:48Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>247.69</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>271686</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-03-05T01:05:21Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-07-19T09:14:48Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>38100</id><name>Mirna Maribel</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mirna Maribel Garcia D.

They live in a rented house because her husband&apos;s earnings won&apos;t cover both a house of their own and their children&apos;s school expenses.  The principal driver behind Martha&apos;s decision to start a business was her children.  She discussed her worries about starting a business with her sister, a seamstress, who helped her by sending her clothes.  She began by selling to friends and neighbors and, little by little, she&apos;s expanded her business.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Martha now wants more clothes so that can offer a bigger variety in her store.  That&apos;s why she&apos;s asking for a US$475 loan, to be repaid in 6 months, that she can use to help her children and, in the future, have a house of their own.  With your help, Martha will make her dream come true.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;La familia de Martha está integrada por ella, su esposo y tres hijos a quienes desea brindarles siempre lo mejor, debido a que no cuentan con casa propia y en dónde viven están rentando, es por lo que lo que gana su esposo no es suficiente para pagar los gastos de la casa, y los de la escuela de sus hijos. El principal motor para que Martha comenzara su propio negocio fueron sus hijos. Al platicarle a su hermana la inquietud de poner un negocio, ella le ayudó enviándole ropa, ya que su hermana tiene un taller de costura, en un inicio Martha comenzó a ofrecerle ropa a sus amigos y vecinos y poco a poco ha ido incrementando su negocio. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Sin embargo Martha desea comprar más ropa para poder tener variedad en su tienda, es por eso que está solicitando un crédito de US $475 que está dispuesta a pagarlos en un plazo de 6 meses y con este dinero Martha podrá sacar adelante a sus hijos y en un futuro poder tener una casa propia. Con tu ayuda Martha logrará hacer su sueño realidad.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>475</funded_amount><paid_amount>475</paid_amount><image><id>132736</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Buy clothes for resale.</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Tampico, Tamaulipas</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>22.216667 -97.85</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2008-02-22T23:40:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>475</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Martha</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-03-08T10:55:50Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>MXN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>5000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>475</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-04-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-05-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-06-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.15</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>842.11</local_amount><processed_date>2008-04-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-28T19:38:11Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>864.44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>176778</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>842.11</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-28T19:38:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>864.44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>204140</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>842.11</local_amount><processed_date>2008-06-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-28T19:40:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>864.44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>231413</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>842.11</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-28T19:42:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>864.44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>260545</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>842.11</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-28T19:43:13Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>864.44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>289423</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>789.47</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-13T07:04:37Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>810.41</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>319763</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-02-23T10:55:50Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-09-13T07:04:37Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>38108</id><name>Cenina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>Cenina belongs to the Banco Comunal &quot;Sacred Heart of Jesus.&quot;
