She earns her living by operating two businesses.  One business sells dried fish and the other rice. Her husband, Joben B., who is 38 years-old, works as a laborer and also helps with his wife&apos;s business activities.  They have three children who are aged 13 to 18 years -old. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2003, Marissa joined Kiva partner NWTF-Project Dungganon because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marissa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000,  uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to expand her rice and dried fish businesses so that she can continue to save for the future. Marissa B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Tuguis, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a General store and a Rice Retailing business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Delia  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her 23 past loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Delia  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, thus uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This time, for her 24th loan, she is again borrowing PHP 29,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her general (sari-sari) store and rice retailing businesses so that she can continue to save up for their future.  The profit she will earn will be part of her savings.  Delia  S. is a &apos;Dungganon&apos; woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 53 years old. Cristina is married and has 5 adult children. To make a living, Cristina owns &amp; operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Cristina is just starting this business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Cristina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cristina is requesting a loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed &amp; other supplies. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Cristina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

Kiyal is 36 and married. She has four daughters, three daughters are at school and the youngest one is not yet. Five years ago with an initial investment of 10000 soms, Kiyal bought a bull and since that moment she started to breed cattle. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her husband works in the police and when he has free time he tries to help Kiyal with her activity. Selling some cattle after fattening, Kiyal makes 5000 soms per month. With money received from the loan she wants to purchase two bulls in order to increase the number of cattle she has. In the future she plans to build a shed and expand her business to have enough money to continue to support her daughters.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. &#13;&#10;MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line – People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is married with seven adult children. The youngest son is serving in the army. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To make a living, Urmat is occupied with cattle breeding.  In the beginning, when she milked cows and sold the milk to her customers, she earned about 210 Kyrgyz Soms daily; today, this sum is nearly equal to 400 Kyrgyz Soms a day. Also, she deals in fattening up of bull-calves. She has been engaged in her business for 30 years and earns approximately 7,000 Kyrgyz Soms a month for these activities. Her main helper is her husband who supports her and maintains the farm. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Urmat is a very energetic and optimistic woman. In spite of finishing only secondary school, she has been able to make her business successful. Now Urmat is requesting a loan of 60,000 Kyrgyz Soms to buy one milk cow and two bull-calves. That allows her further development of her household and business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the future, Urmat plans to make good living conditions for her son and hold his wedding.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

She is 60 years old. Teresita is widowed and has 2 adult children. To make a living, Teresita owns &amp; operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Teresita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise &amp; sell in future. This will be the first loan taken out by Teresita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family&apos;s income. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About GDMPC:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;GDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

C. is from the village of Sta. C., Benito Soliven. He is 38 years old and is married with three school-aged children.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Juanito owns and operates a business providing wood cutting services using his chainsaw in the local community. He has been engaged in his business for over two years and earns approximately 14,000 PHP a month.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2009, Juanito joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials such as oil and gas needed to provide his service.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Juanito is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional materials needed to improve his service such as a new chainsaw blade. This loan will be his 4th from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About ASKI:&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is 44 and married with a daughter and a son. The son is married and lives separately with his own family and the daughter studies at school.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nurbubu and her husband have been breeding livestock for fifteen years and every month they sell some sheep to cover the family expenses. With the money received from the loan Nurbubu wants to purchase more sheep in order to increase the number of their livestock. In the future she plans to build a shed and start repairing her house.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Taalaibek S. is 23 and divorced. In order to make money, he works as a taxi driver using his own car. Three years ago, with an initial investment of 20,000 soms, he started to breed livestock. Then he sold all the livestock and purchased his vehicle. With money received from the loan he wants to purchase auto parts to repair his car.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Farida T., 33, is married with a daughter and a son, both of whom attend school. Five years ago, with an initial investment of 8,000 soms, she bought three sheep and then resold them after fattening. In five years, Farida has increased the number of her livestock to fifteen. She applied for the loan because she wants to improve her living conditions and purchase furniture. In the future she plans to open a kiosk near the house and start selling convenience goods.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Kumushai J. is the treasurer of the group. She is 51 and married with three sons and two daughters. All the children are married and live separately with their families. Ten years ago, with an initial investment of 5,000 soms, Kumushai opened a kiosk and began to sell convenience goods. But then her husband suggested she start selling meat, because nobody in their village does that. When Kumushai started to sell meat, she noticed that the demand for meat is high enough and she makes good money. She applied for the loan because she needs to purchase sheep. In the future she plans to expand her business and then start repairing her house.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Manalad, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living with farming and hog raising businesses. Her husband Efren, 59 years old, works as a farmer to earn a living and also helps in his wife&apos;s business activities. They have 4 children who are 13 to 19 years old.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Rose Marie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rose Marie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;This time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 which she intends to use to sustain her farming and hog raising businesses so that she can continue to save for their future and for the education of their children.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Rose Marie L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.&#13;&#10;&lt;em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;About NWTF&#13;&#10;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>575</funded_amount><paid_amount>575</paid_amount><image><id>580158</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Josefa. She is 31 years old. Rubelyn is married and has four young children. Her eldest is seven years old, while the youngest is only one year old. To make a living, Rubelyn grows crops. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Rubelyn also raises hogs for fattening and sale.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rubelyn joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rubelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Rubelyn is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rubelyn from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About CEVI:&#13;&#10;Community Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years. Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines. In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring. CEVI not only provides credit for its clients, but also savings, insurance, and training, which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in Purok Ipil-ipil, Barangay Bulanon, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1995 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and fishing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lucia is now borrowing PHP 21000 so that she could  purchase additional inventory for her general store and buy materials to make more fishing nets. This will be her 14th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lucia aspires to elevate her family&apos;s living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She hopes to have all her children finish college someday and hopefully for them to have a bright future.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tessie joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Tessie has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Tessie is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase general farm supplies &amp; equipment. This will be the second loan taken out by Tessie from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and to improve their living conditions. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About CEVI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Community Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years. Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines. In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring. CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>150</funded_amount><paid_amount>150</paid_amount><image><id>582759</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To purchase general farm supplies &amp; equipment.</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>Sta.

He earns his living by operating 2 business ventures:  Farming and general store businesses.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Esmeraldo joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because he aspired for something better for his family. With the help of his past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Esmeraldo has been incrementally lifting his family out of poverty by the sweat of his brow. His previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped him earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This time, for his 11th cycle loan, he is borrowing PHP 25,000 which he intends to use to purchase fertilizer for his citrus (calamansi) plantation so that he could continue to save up for future investments. Esmeraldo P. is a Dungganon man who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of his dreams. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of PHP 20000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 50,000, uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living. This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29500, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks to sell in her various businesses. Nenita S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Joselyne, aged 35 years. She is a go-getter businesswoman who has been dealing in general merchandise, owning a retail shop. This stickler of hard work is also a widowed mother of 5. She has basked in the career graces of her business for the last 4 years. With this experience behind her, she has managed to subdue most of the uncertain adversities that have threatened to play havoc with her business. Each month her business generates a profit of 20,000 Ugandan shillings. This, to all intents and purposes, is a low figure. What has played into her hands, as she operates her business, has been her exceptional skill in customer relations. As it is now, she is taking a long view with an aim of maximizing her small profits. She figures this loan will come in significantly handy in helping her buy more inventory as currently she sells small household items.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>581752</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase more inventory for business for resale.</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Bushenyi</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-0.416667 30.166667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>84</partner_id><posted_date>2010-08-14T00:20:02Z</posted_date><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Joselyne</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>John Patrick</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Milton</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Oliver</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Aisha</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-07-21T07:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>UGX</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>550000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2010-08-21T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137500</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2010-09-21T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137500</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2010-10-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137500</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2010-11-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137500</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2010-10-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2010-11-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2010-12-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-01-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>62.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>62.5</amount><local_amount>137500</local_amount><processed_date>2010-08-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2010-09-15T10:47:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>137812.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>166903733</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.5</amount><local_amount>137500</local_amount><processed_date>2010-09-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2010-10-16T09:15:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>137812.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>172297199</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.5</amount><local_amount>137500</local_amount><processed_date>2010-10-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2010-11-15T15:36:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>137812.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>177467474</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>62.5</amount><local_amount>137500</local_amount><processed_date>2010-11-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2010-12-15T15:22:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>137812.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>182605564</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-08-14T23:22:40Z</funded_date><paid_date>2010-12-15T15:22:56Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>222088</id><name>Amparo</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Amparo D. is from Barangay 18, Gingoog City.

With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teodora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10000, uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living. This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10000, which she intends to use to purchase a bigger volume of vegetables to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future. She plans to use the profits for house improvements. Teodora P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She started her business in 2008 and has found success in her trade. She has used her earnings to support her family. After trading a variety of clothing, she has decided to expand her sales types by selling bags and hats, which would enable her to increase her business revenues.

(general store) business. She lives in Sitio Alang-alang, barangay Buanoy, Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her tailoring, house rental and sari-sari store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10000. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Violeta is now borrowing PHP 29500 so that she can purchase more materials for her tailoring business. This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 29500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Violeta aspires to elevate her family&apos;s living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Lydia, aged 54 years, is a mother of 7 children. She has been operating a retail shop business from Bwanda Trading centre in Rukungiri. In the shop, she is selling general merchandise especially for home use, such as: basins, jerrycans, buckets, grocery, sugar, salt and more. She started this business 10 years ago from her previous farming enterprise. At the end of every month she is able to pocket profits to the tune of 185,000 Ugandan shillings. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her main drawback has been having too little stock in her business, therefore not matching  the purchasing rate of her customers. Lydia is seeking a loan that she figures will help her stock more goods that will satisfy the customers’ high demand. She feel that this will also transform her enterprise into a big enterprise. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Being very committed to the business with good customer care, she hopes to increase her sales revenue. This will bring about a transformation for her business and enable her to achieve a self sustaining life. She hopes to cater to her family&apos;s requirements, especially to fulfill her dream of educating her grandchildren. She further looks at buying herself a plot of land where she can set up her own business premises.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>3025</funded_amount><paid_amount>3025</paid_amount><image><id>581816</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

She says she hopes to be strong and healthy to keep up with the hard work required to make their farm productive. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Virginia joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Virginia is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure and other farm supplies. This will be the second loan taken out by Virginia from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About CEVI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Community Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Lourdesita L. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Prenza, Brgy. Balamban, Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: vegetable vending and a &lt;i&gt;carenderia&lt;/i&gt; (food vending) business. Her husband Albino L., who is 63 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and also helps with his wife&apos;s business activities. They have eight children who are 24 to 40 years old. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lourdesita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lourdesita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her previous loan of 12,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000. She intends to use it to purchase raw materials for her businesses so that she could continue to save up for the future and to support her grandchildren&apos;s educations. Lourdesita L. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means &quot;honorable&quot;) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About NWTF:&lt;/b&gt; In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to purchase piglets to raise and the feed needed to raise them. She also intends to use some of the money as revolving funds for her ice cream business so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children.

She lives in Prk. Suyac, Barangay Taba-ao, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4000. Tessie is now borrowing PHP 16000 so that she can purchase more fish to sell. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 13000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

She and her family live together in their own apartment, which she has purchased recently. Gantuguldur&apos;s husband helps with her sewing business and the daughter attends a primary school, while the son goes to a kindergarten in his district. She began her business in 1995 after working as a dressmaker for several years. At first, she sold her products herself out of a rented stall in Narantuul-the biggest and crowdest market of Ulaanbaatar. Now she has expanded her business with three employees and changed her workplace into a bigger and more convenient market called Sunday Plaza. She owns many different sewing machines and designs and sews the clothing according to her customers&apos; tastes. Because of her beautiful designs and the quality craftsmanship of the clothes, Gantuguldur has a large, loyal customer base. She says, “All I want is to grow my business and to open a big manufacturing business”.  Gantuguldur is requesting a 3,500,000 MNT loan in order to purchase a bigger-size stall at Sunday Plaza market.&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2650</funded_amount><paid_amount>2650</paid_amount><image><id>582806</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

She is a good housewife who either takes care of a young child or arranges a daily routine. C. always relies on the income from her husband who works as a machinery repairman. He has a few employees who help provide his service. The family is often affected by transportation problems as they have no vehicle. Therefore, C. has decided to seek a loan of $1200 USD in order to purchase a new motorcycle to provide transport for the family.

She is 45 years old. Teresita is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Teresita owns &amp; operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Jacklyn has found out, you need enormous reserves of patience to succeed. That particular attribute has worked in her favor. She speaks with pride of how their 2 children can all attain education. Her proficiency in attending to the banana plantation for the last 25 years in Ntungamo, alongside the produce business of selling beans, ground nuts and more food stuffs, has brought her the fruits of economic development. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In a month, she makes profits in the amount of 60,000 Ugandan shillings. The only major drawn back problem that has plagued her business, has been the persistent low banana market prices in villages and that she has no ready means of transporting her produce to bigger markets. It is her reckoning that this loan will come in handy in helping her enhance her banana plantations on a large scale through mulching and the buying of fertilizer.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>4450</funded_amount><paid_amount>4450</paid_amount><image><id>581866</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Towards

Eleonor is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Eleonor from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About HSPFI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;HSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Her story illustrates day-to-day preparations in trying to continue her education and running a business in parallel. Today, she is requesting to borrow $800 to purchase a laptop in order to facilitate her work preparation and to do more research.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Note: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his/her picture, not indicating his/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders&apos; understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon&apos;s borrowers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About Ameen:&#13;&#10;Ameen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling snack food products in the local community. Meliza has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month from it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Meliza joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Meliza is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Meliza from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand it. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About HSPFI:&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;HSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She lives in Lebanon.  She has established an accounting business to help provide various types of reports for members of her community and for some companies. With the US $700 she requested from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l., she will purchase a laptop to better market her services and increase the liquidity of her business. She’s certain that with the new laptop, she will deliver her services faster to her clients. She is expecting to expand her business and is very confident that she will be able to achieve substantial growth in the coming years. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Note: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his/her picture, not indicating his/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders&apos; understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon&apos;s borrowers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About Ameen:&#13;&#10;Ameen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999.

Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>This Kiva borrower is a 47-year-old widow woman living with her three children. After the death of her husband, she found herself alone and responsible for the three children. So she decided to operate this mini market in 2006 when she was widowed. The store was opened 10 years ago by her husband. And she was able to manage her grocery shop and make a profit for her family. She offers all types of food products, dairy products, breads, detergents etc. With the loan of US $1200 that she requested, she will be able to increase her store’s inventory. In the future, she expects her business will continue to grow in the coming year.&#10; &#10;It is very common in Lebanon to find small supermarkets selling perishable and non-perishable goods. As members of the communities themselves, storeowners have a deep understanding of local consumer needs and can offer products that meet local demands. The strong network of community relationships are an important component of life in Lebanon, especially in smaller towns and villages.&#10;&#10;Note: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his/her picture, not indicating his/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders&apos; understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon&apos;s borrowers.&#10;&#10;About Ameen:&#10;Ameen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.&#10;&#10;At Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.&#10;&#10;Ameen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

From the threshold, constant challenges can ominously look one in the face and if one does not have that strength of character, everything may go up in smoke. One lady with a wealth of good will who has withstood enormous operating cost challenges in her retail shop business in Buziika- Lugazi over the course of the last 12 years is 34-year-old N. Fatuma, a happily married mother of five. Her reputation, she says, was once at stake, given the bad rapport she had with relatives who often wanted free goods from her shop, against her will. She almost closed her shop and was thinking of relocating. This is a chequered passage anybody who operates a business will face. This business was setup with savings from her farming business. Weekly, her business generates 80,000 shillings, and with this loan, she reckons she will be able to make her business expand by leaps and bounds through the purchase of more goodies for her shop. She is looking at buying more cooking oil, tomatoes, soap and onions to resell.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2650</funded_amount><paid_amount>2650</paid_amount><image><id>581867</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Development Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Any lucrative business driving that roaring lucrative trade can be a springboard to financial success. This normally happens when those holding sway of that business never lose sight of their set objectives in the course of operating. One person who has seen a flood of success in her business is 34-year-old N. Florence, a good-natured divorced mum of two buoyant children. To win her spurs in the last seven years her retail business has been operating in Nakazadde, Lugazi, she has had to adhere to the one factor that is a winning stock in any trade -hard work. She wanted to vie with her friends who were successful in their business ventures. Her personal savings from her restaurant business came in handy in helping her get her business off its feet. Weekly, her business generates 420,000 shillings. This is testimony as to how profitable this business is. She is requesting this loan to buy more merchandise for her shop. She is looking at buying more bags of maize flour (a favorite in her operating area), bags of sugar, salt and plastics.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1825</funded_amount><paid_amount>1825</paid_amount><image><id>581858</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Weekly, his business generates him 40,000 shillings and, because the cost of living in Busaale, Lugazi, is not that high, John can successfully make ends meet.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With the auspices of this loan, John wants to buy more bags of sugar, bags of rice, and bars of soap for his retail shop.

Muhamed, at 53, still works vigorously hard to be able to earn enough to make ends meet out of profits from his one-year-old retail shop in Kitimba, Mpigi. He mostly sells home utensils like basins, plates and cutlery. In a month, he can make as much as 100,000 shillings.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Muhamed has eight kids, all going to school. He has to shoulder all the responsibilities of educating his children and providing meals and medication for them. To do all this he knows he has to summon up all the diligence he has in him.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Customers have been coming steadily and Muhamed is anticipating a scenario where he will attract even more with additional purchases of goods that are in high favor with his community members. He set forth with savings from a produce-selling business. Though it still exists, it is now low key but enables him to get food mostly for home consumption.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Muhamed is requesting this loan to purchase more retail items such as sugar,

In the future she plans to start building her own store.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Eldiyar K. is a 28-year-old farmer who lives in Bekitay village. He is married and has one little daughter. Eldiyar was born into a large family where all the children helped their parents in farming. He was the oldest one so he had to do all of the hard work around the house. He pastured cattle, plowed the land and gathered in the harvest. &#10;&#10;At that time, Eldiyar’s family had one cow and one bull-calf. Later on, they got more cattle. In 2008, Eldiyar got married. His parents gave him one horse and one milk cow, which became the first investment in Eldiyar’s own business. &#10;&#10;During the last two years, his efforts have been aimed at supporting and expanding his household. He managed to multiply the number of cattle and today he has five milk cows and fifteen sheep. Also, he cultivated vegetables on a plot of land and worked hard to get a good harvest of high quality products. &#10;&#10;Eldiyar applied for a loan of 50,000 KGS to buy five bull-calves. With the revenues from this investment, he plans to broaden his business by purchasing more cattle for fattening. Speaking of his plans for future, Eldiyar dreams of establishing a large farm and building his own house. &#10;&#10;Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading micro-finance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan.

She earns her living by operating four business ventures: a restaurant, a general store, a farm and a room-for-rent business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Inocencia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Inocencia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her previous loan of 35,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of $675, uplifting the family&apos;s standard of living. This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing 40,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase ingredients for the food she sells in her restaurant and to start a new business selling soft drinks wholesale. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She works hard and wants to expand her business so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Inocencia S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is 26 years old and married. Ten years ago, with the initial investment of 1,000 KGS, he started to breed cattle. Selling some cattle after fattening, he makes 5,000 soms per month. That profit made it possible for him to save money and celebrate his wedding.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With money received from the loan Aibek wants to purchase six farm animals to resell them after fattening. In the future he plans to increase the number of cattle and start building a new house.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused micro-finance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. &#13;&#10;MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line – People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Nemat is a small producer in the city of Istaravshan in Tajikistan. Together with his children they’ve been raising cattle for more than five years. These produce the income which allows him to feed his family. As well as caring for his livestock, he also cultivates an agricultural crop, wheat, which helps with the family&apos;s diet and provides additional income. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nemat has asked for this loan to buy young cattle in order to obtain a better profit. His greatest wish is to be able to improve his farm by constructing enclosures and establishing better grazing for his livestock.  &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;More about Tajikistan and IMON International:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great&apos;s rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;IMON&apos;s History:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International&apos;s clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

for three years. This young man has many projects for his future, and to build his own house and family is one of them. He&apos;s good at what he does, and this is why he&apos;s been able to support himself and his whole family through his business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;His wish is to add more goods and in that way increase the range of materials and supplies to offer to his clients. Kuvvanjbek would pay back this loan and with the money earned he would be able to pay for his technical career education.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;More about Tajikistan and IMON International&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great&apos;s rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;IMON&apos;s History&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International&apos;s clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He&apos;s married with three children who he must feed and educate. Over the years, he has become very knowledgeable about what is required to raise cattle, their feeding, their calving, etc.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It should be noted that, in the past, this man endured hard economic times for a while, but he&apos;s managed to come through thanks to the help provided by IMON International. IMON International has granted him loans that he has used to buy calves, which is the reason that he needs this loan now. The loan will greatly improve Khairullo’s income and his family&apos;s living standard.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;More about Tajikistan and IMON International&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great&apos;s rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;IMON&apos;s History&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International&apos;s clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Shoirjon is a young man who has dedicated himself to the livestock industry from his childhood. He has been characterized as a very spirited and strong person whose successes are directly applied to his young family, composed of his wife and three children.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The work Shoirjon does is through the raising of livestock for eventual sale. It is necessary to point out that this is the only income that supports his family and that they really need it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Today, Shoirjon looks for support from IMON International to obtain the necessary loan to purchase more cows to raise. With this loan, his beloved family will benefit as much as he will.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;More about Tajikistan and IMON International&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great&apos;s rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Abdumanon is a diligent and tenacious farmer who strives to meet his family’s needs. He is widower, and thus he carries the burden alone through his farming income to meet his family’s needs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Abdumanon works on a 1-hectare (2.5-acre) farm owned by his parents. His harvests are sometimes not maximized because his cultivation method and seeds are not the best. Better farming supplies, seeds and fertilizer require a larger capital, which he didn’t have.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Abdumanon is now relieved that IMON International is helping him obtain the loan he needs to improve his farming. This loan will be used to buy superior seeds, organic fertilizers, and pesticides. He is waiting for his next harvest, which he hopes will yield better results than his previous harvests.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;More about Tajikistan and IMON International&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great&apos;s rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;IMON&apos;s History&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Zarifjon lives in Istaravshan, Tajikistan, where he is a successful businessman who has been selling a variety of spare parts for foreign cars over the past 16 years. The father of three children, he provides the family with necessary food and other needs. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Zarifjon is a great example of someone who started out with a few products that hardly anyone would buy. Currently Zarifjon is requesting a loan of 3000 USD with which to re-stock his inventory and purchase more merchandise. This loan will increase his business sales, allowing Zarifjon to diversify his merchandise and better provide for his family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;More about Tajikistan and IMON International&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great&apos;s rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;IMON&apos;s History&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International&apos;s clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They are all local entrepreneurs who have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to apply for a loan of SLL 500,000 for each. With the help of this loan they will be able to expand their businesses, make more sales and consequently improve their living conditions. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Kadiatu K. is the leader of this group. The twenty-five-year-old is married to a businessman and they have two children who are attending primary school. Kadiatu has been a businesswoman for five years now.

Abduhamid is 25 years old. He is married and has a little daughter. His wife is a teacher at secondary school. Abduhamid is producing tinware. He has been in this business already for 5 years. The finished products are purchased from the house of Abduhamid. The business stability allows him to have income and to ensure the family has the possibility to improve their living conditions. Today Abduhamid  is requesting a loan in the amount of 1500 US Dollars in order to purchase raw materials for producing tinware.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;More about Tajikistan and IMON International&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great&apos;s rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Inomdjon is 58 years old. He is married with three children. Inomdjon has been in business baking bread for the last 12 years. Inomdjon is the main bread-winner in the family and his sons help him with the business. The input materials are as rule purchased by Inomdjon in the local market.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Over the years of his business, Inomdjon found wholesale customers; those usually buy “lepeshka” for their cafes and restaurants. Today Inomdjon is applying for a loan for the third time. He is planning to purchase input materials like flour and coal for baking the bread. With this purpose he requests 1150 US Dollars. Inomdjon would like to thank everyone supporting him and promises to repay the loan in a timely manner. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;More about Tajikistan and IMON International&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great&apos;s rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;IMON&apos;s History&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is married and has 3 children; one is working and the other 2 are in school. She has 3 additional dependents, who live with her, because she wants them to assist her and to attend school.  In 2007, Gracemary established her pharmaceutical drugs business. She began her business because she needed to help her husband to provide basic needs for the family. She works 7 days a week and 12 hours a day. She earns about 1,723,200 SLL every month from this business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Gracemary would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. She requires a loan in order to expand from a drug store to a full-time pharmacy. She hopes to help her grandchildren through school. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 516,960 SLL. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the future, Gracemary plans to become a qualified nurse to make her different from other proprietors of pharmaceutical drug businesses.  She believes a brighter future is in store for her and her business. The majority of her patients are little children from poor backgrounds. She plans to tear down the old store and open a new bigger one.  She thanks you for your

She is married and has 3 children aged 19, 17, and 12. She has 2 additional dependents, who live with her because one of them lost his mother and the other is her husband&apos;s younger brother.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2003, Ramatu established her ice cream and yogurt ice business. She began her business because her husband’s income is low so she started business to meet the home challenges. Her business has gone from one freezer to now eight. Working 6 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about 3,440,000 SLL every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ramatu requires a loan in order to increase her purchases of raw materials. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 344,000 SLL. In the future, Ramatu plans to send her two children to university and to increase production.   Competition is there but the quality of her production helps her business.  She thanks you for your

She is married, and has 2 children, aged 14 and 11 years. In 2002, Zainab established her foodstuffs business. She began her business because after high school, she preferred going into business with a very small start.   She now appreciates the level of stock and the huge customer base she has. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 1,767,600 SLL every month from this business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Zainab would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. Zainab requires a loan in order to purchase stock wholesale. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 123,732 SLL. For the future, Zainab is confident and full of hope as she is the sole trader, doing business in a new community. She hopes to build a whole store and to send her children to university.  The majority of the people in her community are poor women, men and children. She thanks you for your support.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1025</funded_amount><paid_amount>1025</paid_amount><image><id>582890</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

of every operating day. This, the married mother of six says, has helped her give a good account of not only her business, but herself, too. Five years of operating a food sales business at a stall in Buikwe market-Lugazi has kept her well grounded. Prior to running this business, she was a housewife. Much encouragement from a friend helped her take root. In a week, she makes profits that total up to 320,000 shillings. With this loan, she wants to purchase more maize flour, rice, cassava, potatoes and beans for resale.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>4050</funded_amount><paid_amount>4050</paid_amount><image><id>582906</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

She doesn’t take care of any additional family members. She owns a stall at her home in Mengo Mackay, selling rice. She wants to use this loan of 800,000 UGX to buy more bags of rice. She has been in this rice business for many years. She buys bags of rice from Kamuli district and uses public transport to and from Kamuli. Besides the rice business, she also gets additional income from rental rooms. She sells to all categories of people for retail and works six days a week. She depends on this job for a living, and her main business challenge is the transportation of bags of rice from Kamuli to her home in Mengo Mackay. She aspires to own a delivery van and also to start selling on wholesale only. She decided to join MCDT because they are cooperative and work with poor women. Geraida resides in and owns a house that has electricity and piped water. Her monthly expenses includes food and paying utility bills.

Su mercado lo constituyen muchos amigos del gremio educativo, familiares, recomendados, pero especialmente empleados que tengan buenos hábitos de pago. Este su credikiva, es  su primer crédito con la Fundación Mario Santo Domingo,  con él comprará   productos nutricionales  al por mayor y de contado, además de mercancía para la temporada como electrodomésticos menores y sobre todo ropa y calzado, aprovechando la alta demanda en el segundo semestre del año, por parte de sus mercados.&#10; &#10;Su meta es continuar incrementando las ventas para mejorar su nivel de vida y lo más importante es que a Policarpo le favorece mucho su ubicación pues está en el epicentro del comercio del sur de Barranquilla, cerca al estadio Metropolitano de esta ciudad, escenario cuna del futbol Colombiano.&#10;</es><en>For Policarpo P. V., his work as a teacher never ends.  Even though he&apos;s retired from teaching, he continues practicing his vocation, but now he advises his students on everything relating to nutrition.  At 61 years old, Professor Policarpo works marketing nutritional products to improve the body&apos;s defenses while energizing and balancing it.  He also sells a variety of additional products, like clothes, shoes, and small electrical appliances.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He began his business in 2005 when he was a teacher in the Departamento de Bolívar, but after retiring, he began working more persistently.  He is always available to work every day so he can make more money.  His customer base consists of friends from his teaching days, relatives, recommended customers, and employees with good payment habits.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This Kiva loan is his first with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  With the loan, he will buy nutritional products wholesale in cash, as well as seasonal merchandise of clothes, shoes, and small electrical appliance in order to make the most of his customer&apos;s high demand during the second half of the year.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;His goal is to continue increasing his sales so he can improve his quality of life.  Policarpo really enjoys his shop&apos;s location, since it is in the epicenter of shopping in southern Barranquilla near the Atlético Junior&apos;s football stadium, Estadio Metropolitano.&lt;br

She owns a restaurant in Nakulabye selling all types of food, both African (like bananas, cassava, and potatoes), and Western (like chips and sausages). She wants to use this loan to buy more bunches of bananas, rice, sacks of cassava and potatoes.  She buys foodstuffs from Nakulabye market and so incurs little transport costs to and from shopping.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mary works from her home and so doesn’t pay rent for her business. She sells to all categories of people but on retail only. She works six days a week. Her business challenge is the rainy season because she works from a muddy place and so this hinders her customers to reach out to her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Besides this food business she also gets additional income from rental rooms.  She has been in the hotel business for over ten years.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is aspiring of improving her standards of living.   She decided to join MCDT because of the low interest charged.  Mary resides in and owns a three roomed house and the family has access to electricity but not to piped water.

Elle vit dans une famille polygame avec son mari et ses enfants dans le quartier de  Koulikoro de la ville de Koutiala (Région de Sikasso). &#10;Pour des raisons sociales, Aoua  n’a pas eu la chance d’étudier, ce qui justifie son intégration dans le commerce qu’elle apprit auprès de sa mère depuis à bas âge. Après avoir mené plusieurs activités sans réussite, elle s’est finalement initiée à l’achat la vente d’articles divers (tels les tissus, chaussures, et autres) depuis 11 ans.  Madame Aoua  Traoré est très  sollicitée et appréciée par ses clients pour la qualité de ses articles.  &#10;Pour augmenter la taille de son activité et satisfaire sa clientèle, Aoua  a décidé de rejoindre  l’institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso il  y a  3 ans.

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband and children in the Koulikoro neighborhood of the city of Koutiala (Sikasso Region).   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;For sociocultural reasons Aoua never went to school, which is why she is now practicing the business she learned at her mother&apos;s knee.  After unsuccessfully  trying a number of different activities, she settled into buying and selling assorted goods (fabrics, shoes, etc.) 11 years ago.  She is greatly sought after, and her clients appreciate her because of the quality of her goods.  In order to grow her business and satisfy her clients, Aoua decided to join the microfinance partner Soro Yiriwaso 3 years ago.  She has been a part of 4 group loans and is now requesting her second individual loan; all her previous loans were repaid on time. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She plans to buy 20 wax print wraps with this loan.  She buys her goods at the Koutiala market and sells them in town for cash or credit, to a clientele of both women and men.

Most live in polygamous families in Missiritou, one of the villages of the Dioïla prefecture, Koulikoro region, 2nd administrative region of Mali. They collaborate with the Soro Yiriwaso  microfinance institution in order to better organize their businesses at the beginning of the rainy season.  The crops grown are, among others, pearl millet, peanuts and beans.  This is their second planting loan and the preceding loan has been fully repaid.

Juntos residen en la hermosa selva cusqueña, específicamente en la comunidad de Villa Quintiarina, donde tiene su propio techo a base de adobe. Desde su adolescencia tenia ese sueño de estudiar la carrera de ingeniería civil, pero por cosas del destino no pudo cumplir su sueño, debido a la economía precaria que existía en su familia, no obstante siguió con su rutina diaria, trabajando en la chacra de sus  padres. Después de un largo tiempo Adrian, retomó sus propias decisiones para incursionar en un nuevo proyecto, específicamente cultivando y comercializando producto de cacao, desde luego que a inicios le fue difícil, pero con el tiempo logró posicionarse. En la actualidad su producto lo vende a otras localidades, por lo que recibe buenos resultados económicos. Por lo general trabaja por cuenta propia y en ocasiones recibe la ayuda de sus hijos, pero en temporada de cosecha tiene a cargo de sus peones que le ayudan a facilitar la extracción de su producto final, en el que luego son vendidos en los centros de acopio de su comunidad. Este es su quinto crédito con MFP, por el cual se compromete a seguir cumpliendo con su cronograma de pagos, además está contento con su grupo comunal, debido a que todos son puntuales en sus pagos. Con el crédito que solicita lo piensa invertir en la compra de insumos y abono, con al finalidad de que le dé un mantenimiento adecuado a sus plantaciones de cacao.&#10;&#10;</es><en>&#13;&#10;Adrian, 38, is a single father; he has three school age children.  They all live together in the beautiful Cusco backcountry, specifically in Villa Quintiarina, where he owns his own adobe dwelling.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When he was an adolescent he wanted to study Civil Engineering but destiny prevented him from doing so due to his family’s precarious financial situation.  Notwithstanding, he continued with his daily routine working his parents’ farmlands.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After a long time, Adrian retook control of his own decisions and entered into a new project, specifically farming cacao beans.  Of course, it was difficult at first but in time he managed to stabilize.  Now he sells his product in other locations thereby obtaining good economic results.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Usually he works alone and sometimes gets help from his children.  During harvest, however, he employs two laborers that help him reap his final product that’s later sold to his community’s crop gathering center.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is his 5th loan with MFP and he pledges to continue to repay in a timely manner.  He is happy with his communal group because all of the members are punctual with their repayments.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He will use the requested funds to buy supplies and manure aimed at giving his crops proper care and maintenance.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>583057</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To buy manure.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>CUSCO</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-13.518333 -71.978056</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2010-08-13T19:00:02Z</posted_date><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Adrian </first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-07-14T07:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>2000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2010-08-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2010-09-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2010-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2010-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2010-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-03-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-04-12T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2010-10-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2010-11-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2010-12-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-01-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-02-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-04-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-05-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>0</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>725</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>shared</currency_exchange><currency_exchange_coverage_rate>0.2</currency_exchange_coverage_rate></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>725</amount><local_amount>2000</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T11:33:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2036.89</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206195479</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-08-16T05:17:22Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-05-15T11:33:26Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>222294</id><name>Renacer Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>NELLY SE CASO A LOS 17 AÑOS, NO TENIA NINGUN ESTUDIO Y FUE SU ESPOSO QUIEN LE DIO LA CARRERA TECNICA D.

She didn’t have a formal education and it was her husband who taught her how to sew and manufacture clothing.  It was a bit of a challenge at first, because she also had to care for her one year old son.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has always wanted to work on her own and it was a friend who encouraged her to lease a workshop in a central location.  This allowed her to earn additional income and improve her quality of life.  Her husband bought her first sewing machine (basic), which she still keeps as a memento.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nelly began making dresses and skirts.  Her neighbors knew that she was a seamstress and it was they who recommended her services to their friends.  She began to increase her income little by little, completed her studies, and over time began buying more fabrics and thread with the loans she received.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She had the opportunity to become well known in the various schools, where she maD. uniforms for teachers, but it became necessary for her to acquire a chain stitch sewing machine.  For this reason she approached Edaprospo-Prosperidad to request a loan in order to buy the machine.  Things went well for her and she began making wedding gowns and formals.  This generated additional income for her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She did a good job managing her business and was able to buy more machines and the income provided her the means with which to pay for her three children’s education.  They have all achieved professional careers.  She was also able to buy her own workshop in a central location and no longer offers her services to private institutions because her business is doing very well.  The income she now earns is for herself and for her husband, and to treat her grandchildren.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nelly will use the money from this loan to buy fabric because she has orders for dresses for the Peruvian Independence Day.  It makes her feel good to have achieved most of her goals and to continue to be able to support her family by running the business she enjoys; dressmaking.&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1175</funded_amount><paid_amount>1175</paid_amount><image><id>583059</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Tailoring</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Fabric</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Chosica</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-11.943056 -76.709444</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>93</partner_id><posted_date>2010-08-13T20:10:03Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1175</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Nelly Julia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Petronila </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Lidia Soledad</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Hilda Esther</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Miguel Antonio</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Lucia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Norma </first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-07-23T07:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>3300</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1175</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2010-08-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>825</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2010-09-21T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>825</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2010-10-21T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>825</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2010-11-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>825</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2010-10-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>293.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2010-11-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>293.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2010-12-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>293.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-01-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>293.75</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>293.75</amount><local_amount>825</local_amount><processed_date>2010-08-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2010-09-15T10:01:03Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>825.29</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>166831598</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>293.75</amount><local_amount>825</local_amount><processed_date>2010-09-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2010-10-15T09:55:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>825.29</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>172098157</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>293.75</amount><local_amount>825</local_amount><processed_date>2010-10-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2010-11-15T13:36:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>825.29</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>177390826</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>293.75</amount><local_amount>825</local_amount><processed_date>2010-11-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2010-12-15T13:44:04Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>825.29</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>182529106</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-08-15T19:45:48Z</funded_date><paid_date>2010-12-15T13:44:04Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>222295</id><name>Rodrigo</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Rodrigo is a 70-year-old father who lives with his wife and son,  in Montes de Oca, located in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Rodrigo runs a nursery where he sells various plants and small trees which bear fruit. His customers purchase decorative plants as well as fruit-producing plants such as banana and squash. He plans to use this loan to increase his productive output, in other words, the number of plants in his salable inventory.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rodrigo will use this loan to invest in the construction of two new greenhouses. Specifically, this loan will help to finance the creation of irrigation systems, the purchase of tubing, seeds, nutrients and other inputs necessary to the production of plants. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rodrigo is a busy entrepreneur; as a result, he must organize his day efficiently. In the mornings and the afternoons he dedicates a few hours to his nursery. Nursery tasks include planning, planting, watering and preparing pots, among others.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At his age, Rodrigo still dreams. He hopes to increase his income in order to be able to manage costs (schooling costs of his grandson, rent on the land occupied by the nursery) with more ease. Rodrigo´s main obstacle is a lack of access to working capital. He hopes that this loan will enable him to offer a greater variety of plants, of superior condition and in better quality pots.

He began his business because he was working before but deemed it fit and profitable if he started his own business.  In the rains many people fall ill, so that is the time he makes more money. He works 7 days a week and 9 hours a day, and he earns about 941,600 SLL every month from this business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Fetus has a very good loan repayment history.  He would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Festus needs a loan in order to increase stock. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 141,240 SLL. In the future, Festus plans to increase stock in a way that could lead to an established pharmacy that could cater for all categories of people. Fetus’s pharmaceutical drugs business services the remote community with a large customer base.

She moulds it into balls and wraps the balls in corn husk.

Of his five children only one is dependent on him, a son who is in high school. Constancio makes a living growing potatoes on his 3 hectares of land in Kuri Mayu, a rural community 62 kilometers away from the city, so it is very difficult to be approved for a loan from a bank. Kiva partner Cidre took the initiative of going to this rural area. Constancio tells us that his wife died in a traffic accident while she was returning from the Colomi flea market after selling her products there. What Constancio wants is for his youngest son to finish his studies and become a professional like an agronomy technician so he can work and earn a good income so he can provide and care for him when he becomes an old man so he doesn&apos;t suffer. With the loan, he plans to plant more potatoes so he can be able to save money for his son&apos;s education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>583100</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Purchase potato seeds and other supplies necessary for planting it</use><location><country_code>BO</country_code><country>Bolivia</country><town>Cochabamba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-17.383333 -66.15</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>140</partner_id><posted_date>2010-08-14T02:10:03Z</posted_date><loan_amount>700</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Constancio</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-07-23T07:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>700</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>700</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>233.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-07-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>233.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2012-01-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>233.34</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>233.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>233.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2012-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>233.34</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2011-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-03-15T11:33:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>195819595</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>300</amount><local_amount>300</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T10:37:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>300</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206129220</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2012-01-31T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2012-02-17T08:54:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>257540063</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-08-16T12:08:19Z</funded_date><paid_date>2012-02-17T08:54:36Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>222320</id><name>Mary</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mary A. is married and has six dependents.

She sells various products including books, clothing for children as well as for adults, cleaning products and personal hygiene products. She also has a photocopying machine.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Teresita plans to use this loan to invest in the purchase of inventory that she will sell in her store. She says that her lack of access to working capital (i.e. loans from formal lending institutions) has hindered her ability to expand her business, gain more clients and increase revenues.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Teresita organizes her day in the following manner: she wakes up early and cleans the house and store. If a client passes by, she opens up (no earlier than 6 a.m.) and the day begins. She stays open all day until 8 p.m.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Teresita’s main goal is to expand her business, fill her store with a variety of products and increase her revenues. A main obstacle for Teresita is that she lives in a rural area with a small population, which makes clients hard to come

María del Carmen es toda una experta en negocios, porque siempre, desde el año 1986, ha tenido uno: el primero fue un restaurante con su esposo, cuando éste se pensionó; luego una peluquería en su propia casa, al que adicionó la venta de prendas de oro y en el 1991 viajaba y traía mercancía para la venta desde Maicao, municipio fronterizo con Venezuela, pero cuando esta forma de negociar no fue rentable y empezó a encontrar en Barranquilla mercancía a buen precio, se dedicó exclusivamente a la venta de esta mercancía variada , mediante el sistema de crédito. María ha recibido 6 créditos con la Fundación Mario Santo Domingo que ha amortizado efectivamente, su credikiva es su séptimo crédito, con él comprará una lavadora, ropa, calzado y una balanza para negocio, todo esto ya encargado. Los financiamientos otorgados a María del Carmen han sido muy valiosos, porque con ellos ha logrado utilidades, convertidas hoy en aportes para su hogar, especialmente en lo que tiene que ver con la alimentación, el vestuario de sus hijos, apoyo a sus nietos y el poder contar siempre un capital efectivo para compras de oportunidad e inversión para su negocio. Aun sigue con el sueño de tener un restaurante bien organizado, porque le apasiona el área de preparación de alimentos. Sus desafíos están relacionados con la oferta de mercancías que hace la competencia, que muchas veces suele ser más económica, pero ella está en la tarea de explicarle a sus clientes, la relación del precio con la durabilidad como elementos de calidad, con la que ella trabaja. María F. es una mujer muy activa participa en la Junta de acción comunal del barrio donde vive, donde hace mucha gestión comunitaria, por eso la conocen en Soledad y además siempre está a la expectativa de captar nuevos clientes reales que le signifiquen ingresos. </es><en>María F. G. makes a living selling all types of merchandise, especially household appliances, clothing, and shoes.  She lives in the city of Soledad, which is 15 minutes away from Barranquilla, with her husband and four children who range in age from 18 to 39.  María del Carmen is an expert at her business because she has always worked in her own venture since 1986.  The first business she had was a restaurant she managed with her husband when he became a pensioner.  Later she started a beauty salon in her home and eventually began selling gold jewelry in 1991.  María also traveled and brought back merchandise to sell from Maicao, a town that lies near the border with Venezuela.  Whenever her traveling retail business became less profitable, she began purchasing merchandise in Barranquilla at a better price.  Now she devotes herself exclusively to selling different types of merchandise on credit.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;María has received six previous loans from Fundación Mario Santo Domingo and has paid them off effectively.  This Kiva loan will be her seventh one and she will use it to purchase a washing machine, clothing, shoes, and a scale for her business since she has already received orders for these items.  The loans that were provided to María del Carmen have been valuable because they helped her generate income to buy products for her home, especially food and clothing for her children.  She also supports her grandchildren, so she would like to have sufficient capital so that she can take advantage of buying opportunities and investments in her business.  She continues to dream of having a well-organized restaurant once again because she is passionate about preparing food.  Her greatest challenge with her retail business is competition because there have been many instances in which other merchants sell goods that are much cheaper.  However, it is her job to explain to her customers the relationship between price and specific elements of quality such as durability.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;María is an active board member of the community action committee in her neighborhood, which does a lot of work related to community development.  She is well-known in Soledad and is always looking for new customers to help generate more income.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

B. LAURA LOURDES&#10;&#10;Hace seis años Laura emprende en el negocio de crianza de cuyes, es muy gracioso escucharla decir que estos animalitos no le gustaban de joven y que ahora es un sustento para su hogar.&#10;Fue en el cumpleaños de su prima quien le regaló cuatro cuyes hembras para que empiece a criarlos, tuvo que comprar un macho para la reproducción, el alimento que les da a estos animalitos es alfalfa, harina de pescado y afrechin. El primer crédito que recibió lo invirtió para comprar medicamento de desparasitación lo cual lo hace dos veces al año.&#10;Las hembras salieron preñadas; las crías los venden cuando tienen unos cuantos meses de crecido, a veces también lo utiliza para su propia alimentación. Actualmente tiene dieciocho cuyes y dos hembras quienes están preñadas. Estas ventas le ayudan en educar a sus hijos uno está estudiando en la universidad la especialidad de Físico-Matemática y los otros dos aún estudian en el colegio. El préstamo es para compra un macho y comprar alimento balanceado. Asimismo Laura cocina en una parroquia de Huarochiri donde percibe un ingreso mas para su economía familiar.&#10;</es><en>Laura Lourdes C. Briceño&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Laura began raising guinea pigs as a business 6 years ago.  It&apos;s comical to hear her say that as a child she didn&apos;t like these little critters but how they now help support the household.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was on a cousin&apos;s birthday when she received 4 female guinea pigs so she could begin raising them; she had to purchase a male to begin reproduction.  The animals are fed alfalfa, fishmeal, and bran.  She invested her first loan in deworming medication which she applies twice a year.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The females turned out pregnant and the offspring are later sold after a few months, she even sometimes uses them to feed herself.  She currently has 18 guinea pigs, 2 of which are pregnant.  The sales are helping her get her children through school, one is at the university specializing in physics-math and her other two children are still in school.  &#13;&#10;The loans is for the purchase of balanced feed, and a male guinea pig.  Laura also cooks at a parish in Huarochiri as another form of income for her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Gustavo  Gutierrez, Kiva

Q., 36, lives in his parents’ home in the May 3rd neighborhood of the city of Tarija. Pastor is married to Angelica Vargas Gutierrez, 33, with whom he has four children. Pastor works as a taxi driver which he has done for over ten years. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Pastor wants a better income in order to offer a better life to his family, but tells us he needs to purchase a system for outfitting his vehicle for natural gas by which his fuel costs would be much lower and his expenses would be cut by more than half. Thus the loan will be used to purchase a natural gas system so that he will be able to enhance his income. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Pastor tells us that he wants to do as much as he can for his spouse and children and so the next loan request he makes will be for improving the condition of the house where they live. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by

Benedicto tells us he has little land to sow on but others have large amounts of land that they are offering him to work on.  To be able to do that he needs materials to sow and grow more potatoes to make a highest possible profit which will allow him to save up money to buy his own land and let his children study.&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Susan Garza, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>583185</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>The purchase of seeds and fertilizer to grow potatoes.</use><location><country_code>BO</country_code><country>Bolivia</country><town>Cochabamba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-17.383333 -66.15</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>140</partner_id><posted_date>2010-08-16T04:10:02Z</posted_date><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Benedicto </first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2010-07-30T07:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>720</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>725</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2011-01-30T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>360</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2011-07-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>360</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-03-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>362.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2011-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>362.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>198.83</amount><local_amount>197.46</local_amount><processed_date>2011-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-04-15T10:42:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>198.83</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>201262289</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>163.67</amount><local_amount>162.54</local_amount><processed_date>2011-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-05-15T10:37:29Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>163.67</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>206129221</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>362.5</amount><local_amount>360</local_amount><processed_date>2011-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2011-07-15T10:46:10Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>362.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>216479497</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2010-08-16T18:16:14Z</funded_date><paid_date>2011-07-15T10:46:10Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>222386</id><name>Luisa</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>La señora Luisa es cliente desD. el año 2004 comenzó con el grupo solidario Flor del Campo durante cinco años, actualmente se independiza como crédito individual por que el otro integrante del grupo viajo a su pueblo y no se sabe cuando retornara.

N., tiene la edad de 42 años, es casada, y tiene 2 hijos que son su mayor prioridad. Ella quiere comprar una vaca para la producción de leche para el consumo de su familia y si es posible para la venta. Además, su finca es de 3 hectáreas con pasto de buena calidad y también cuenta con más terneros en desarrollo y engorde. La propiedad de Mirna cuenta con un clima más fresco y con una cantidad de agua potable que fluye naturalmente desde la zona protegida del Cerro Chirripó. Tiene varios años que se dedica a su finca y quiere crecer. Es el primer préstamo que ha recibido de FUDECOSUR. Ella no tenía problemas en su propiedad, pero si tiene el deseo de que sea una finca que se le aproveche mejor sus condiciones productivas. También, ella no ha realizados otros préstamos en bancos estatales o entidades financieras, pero FUDECOSUR le brindó el préstamo con mayores facilidades y la tasa de interés es mucho más baja. Ella también tiene el deseo de brindarles a sus hijos la educación necesaria  para que sea en el futuro una persona preparada y pueda enfrentar de manera más fácil la vida.&#10;&#10;About FUDECOSUR:&#10;The Foundation for the Development of Southern Communities is dedicated to economically empowering its clients by providing credit and capacitating programs to improve living conditions of micro-entrepreneurs and their children across Southern Costa Rica.

She would like to purchase a cow to provide milk for her family and, if possible, to sell the milk as well. She has 3 hectares of farmland with good grass and more calves that she is fattening up. Her property enjoys a cool climate and has a large quantity of drinkable water that flows from the protected area of Cerro Chirripó. She has worked the farm for many years and wants it to grow. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is the first loan that Mirna has received from FUDECOSUR. She has no problems with her property, but wants to take better advantage of the opportunities for production. She has not taken out loans with other state banks or financial organizations, as FUDECOSUR offers her better credit facilities and much lower interest rates. She would also like to provide her children with the necessary education so that in the future they can be more prepared to deal with what life brings them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About FUDECOSUR:&#13;&#10;The Foundation for the Development of Southern Communities is dedicated to economically empowering its clients by providing credit and capacitating programs to improve living conditions of micro-entrepreneurs and their children across Southern Costa Rica.

They will soon be relocated to a gallery in construction as ordered by the state, as part of the city&apos;s pedestrian zone organizing process. Ivan&apos;s business is located where there is much competition and he takes advantage of that. He knows his competitors and understands that his sustainability depends upon interrelations with them, as does increasing his income, which is occurring day to day.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ivan&apos;s punctual repayment of his 4 loans with the Fundación Mario Santo Domingo have distinguished him. For this reason, he is now soliciting a Kiva loan to continue increasing his sales, augmenting his working capital, and to continue improving his family&apos;s standard of living, as he has been doing up to now. With this loan he wants to acquire additional cellular phone plans and to buy the products generally needed by a tobacconist&apos;s shop. In the future he plans to obtain his own home through the &apos;Sueños y Opportunidades&apos; (Dreams and Opportunities) program in Villas D.

It is an agricultural district, which is comprised of various rural areas that are quite separate from each other.  This district belongs to the Lambayeque province, which is over two hours from the city of Chiclayo.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He has been selling medicine in a pharmacy for two years.  He has a place, which is located close to the center of the town.  This business is very well received because his main customers are the people who live in the diverse populated centers in the area.  The customers do not have enough money to go to the city of Chiclayo to get the medicines.  With the earnings from this activity he helps his parents support the family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Yuri wishes to expand his business by purchasing more medicine.

A year ago, she started a job as a sewing employee in the garment industry, while her husband has been a construction foreman for eight years. He has a few employees who help provide his service.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Lorie S. is a young mother who aims to become successful someday by increasing her fishing business while her husband closely works with her as a fisherman. They work together for the future of their family. Lorie is thankful to ASHI, for through the loans they have provided since 1998, she has been able to support her fishing operation by purchasing a motor boat, fishing net, and other tools of her business. She is hoping to raise more fish to sell in the future through hard work and the continuous assistance of ASHI and Kiva. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because a lack of business capital encouraged her to look for financial support from KIVA lenders, Lorie will be glad when her loan request is granted; she will utilize the loan wisely by purchasing an additional fishing boat and fishing net. Lorie’s hard work and patience are her foundation in bettering her family&apos;s life.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The income she gets from the business is very helpful in supporting the business itself and meeting the needs of her family, especially in providing school allowances for her three children. She hopes that someday she will be able to expand her fishing business further. She is glad for the secured opportunity of taking this loan and for your support and encouragement. Lorie hopes to maintain a long-term sustainable fishing business.

business despite that. The farming business has brought pleasure to Paquita’s family. Because of its profits, she has been able to support the family’s needs. Being a good mother, Paquita has always wanted to support her children in whatever career they would follow to better their own lives. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aside from Paquita’s farming business financed by the loan she received from ASHI, she also has a hog raising business which is her way of saving her profits to support the needs of her family, especially for her grandchildren’s education until college. For that, Paquita is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders to be able to purchase fertilizers,“palay” (unhusked rice), and support her hog raising business. This will make their business grow and make more profit, which will enable her to support her ambitions in life.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Paquita has been an ASHI member since 1998. Her family is very glad that she has an opportunity to improve their quality of living through the income of the farming business she has established with the support of the loans she has requested.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Fely T. is a 62-year-old mother of five. She is married to a farmer who works a small parcel of their land. Her husband is also hired by other people in their village during the rice planting and harvest season. This livelihood of hers started more than 10 years ago, but improving the family&apos;s living conditions remains impossible. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Fely applied for this loan to finance fertilizers, insecticides, and other supplies. She wants to buy these items in advance in order to get a lower price, and to avoid borrowing money from her neighbor during planting season. When she borrows from her neighbor, she usually pays back in rice grains after harvest which is very disadvantageous to her. Fely hopes that through her loan, she and her husband can save their harvest and get a better price at market. Fely also engaged her second venture--raising livestock in their wide and verdant backyard for supplementary income.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Fely and her husband lack the education that is required to be employed. Therefore, they have used their own skills to earn money for their children and to survive. Fely has never wanted anything else in her life as a mother other than to give her children a better future by sending them to school through college. However, she failed with her four eldest children, because some of them married at an early age and others stopped going to school and worked instead. Fely&apos;s last hope is youngest child who is in the fourth year of high school and will soon be in college, and, also, her grandchildren. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She also wants to have an electricity connection for their farm’s operation and to build a better house for the family.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>in_repayment</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>348.5</paid_amount><image><id>583310</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>buying

Consuelo, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: farming and selling meat products.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nenita’s husband, Romeo, is a driver and they have nine children from 17 to 35 years old. One of their children is currently going to school and also helps in the business, while the other eight children are already working on their own livelihoods.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of their family&apos;s life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in farming and selling meat by delivery. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000 from her business activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nenita is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 was used to fund operations of her meat sales business. The loan had a positive impact on both the business and the family’s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 20th loan, the amount of PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizer for her farm. Nenita is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The accompanying picture of Nenita was taken with her standing crop of sugarcane in the background.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She is 28 years old. Precila is married and has three infant children. To make a living, Precila owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Precila has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Precila joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Precila is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Precila from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures. She sells firewood and charcoal, and she has a tricycle transport businesses.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nerlita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nerlita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus improving the family&apos;s standard of living.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This time, for her thirteenth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to do repairs and maintenance to her tricycle and as additional revolving capital for her charcoal and firewood business. She intends to continue to save for their future and to do house repairs. Nerlita A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

To make a living, Leticia owns and operates a general store selling a variety of perishable and non-perishable products in the local community. Engaged in her business for over 15 years, she earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2009, Leticia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase additional products to sell, she is now requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP for the same purpose. This will be Leticia&apos;s third loan from ASKI, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand her store. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She sews curtains, and she sells ukay-ukay (used clothes) and ready-to-wear clothes. She lives in Sitio Purit, Brgy. Cabito-onan, Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5000. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Apolinaria is now borrowing PHP 22000 so that she can purchase more inventory for her curtain business. This will be her thirteenth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Apolinaria aspires to elevate her family&apos;s living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 42 years old. Brenda is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Brenda raises pigs for fattening and sale. Brenda has been engaged in her business for more than four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Brenda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Brenda is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby pigs to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Brenda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers, and small-business entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>125</funded_amount><paid_amount>125</paid_amount><image><id>582727</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

G. is from the town of Gomez San Isidro. She is 28 years old. Jenny is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Jenny runs a general store, where she sells a variety of different products in the local community. Jenny has been engaged in her business for only one year and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month from these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Jenny joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jenny is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Jenny&apos;s first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve and expand her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Cruz, Benito Soliven, is 46 years old, married, and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Zosima owns and operates a specialized retail store selling fruits and vegetables in the local community.  Engaged in her business for over two years, she earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2008, Zosima joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having  repaid her previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase additional products to sell, she is now requesting a loan of 9,000 PHP for the same purpose. This will be Zosima fifth loan from ASKI, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand her store.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>582222</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase additional products to sell</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>Sta.

C. is from the village of Sta. C., Benito Soliven. She is 43 years old. Menecia is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Menecia runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Menecia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 7,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month from it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2009, Menecia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Menecia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Menecia is requesting a new loan of 22,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Menecia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About ASKI:&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>582234</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase additional products to sell</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>Sta.

Cruz, Benito Soliven. She is 30 years old. Mercy is married and has two young children. To make a living, Mercy raises crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Mercy has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 9,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) per month from it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2009, Mercy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mercy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mercy is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be the second loan taken out by Mercy from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand her business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About ASKI:&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>582237</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise</use><location><country_code>PH</country_code><country>Philippines</country><town>Sta.

She is 45 years old. Leonila is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Leonila raises crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Leonila has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 15,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) per harvest from it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Leonila joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonila is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be the first loan taken out by Leonila from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;About ASKI:&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He has been doing this work for over seven years. He has obtained a good reputation among his customers. His selection in clothes is always admired by his customers. He also keeps himself aware of the new designs and fabrics in clothes to attract more customers to his work. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He generates an income of approximately 15,000 Pakistan rupees, which enables him to meet the financial expenses.

She is 46 years old, married, and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, she operates a food stand, selling vegetables to the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $150 per harvest for her activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2009, Rosemarie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional vegetables to sell. Rosemarie is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more vegetables to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He is 43 years old, married, and has three daughters and a son.  The older daughter studies at university and the others are at school. Five years ago, with the initial investment of 10,000 KGS, Mamasabir and his wife started to grow rice. Selling some part of the harvest, Mamasabir makes about $195 per month.  That profit made it possible for him to save money and purchase a vehicle. With money received from this loan he wants to purchase two tons of mineral fertilizers which are needed for sowing rice. In the near future Mamasabir plans to celebrate his daughter’s wedding.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused micro-finance institution in Kyrgyzstan. &#13;&#10;MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line – People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately $175 a month for these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Jennifer joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines.

Then he decided to grow rice instead of wheat, because the profit from selling the rice is higher.  In this way he makes about $130 per month. That profit made it possible for him to save money and purchase a vehicle.

Milagros is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory &amp; working capital. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Milagros from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand the business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About HSPFI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;HSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She works part time in an embroidering clothes making business to financially support her husband. She is basically a housewife but takes time out after managing the household chores for her embroidery business.  &#13;&#10;Her husband is a very skillful man. He has a business making &amp; selling of bed-sheets. He has been doing this work for over seven years. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Kalsoom is the mother of seven children, three sons and four daughters. Her eldest son helps his father in his bed-sheets business. Kalsoom has transferred her art of embroidery to her daughters who are now earning good income from their quality work. Kalsoom has decided to convert her part time business into full-time to better generate income. She has applied for a loan from Asasah for purchasing an embroidery machine, which will help her make more money and to fulfill orders on time. This is her second loan cycle with ASASAH. In her first loan cycle she helped her daughters start their embroidery business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She hopes that she will be able to become successful in her business with the help of this investment.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>775</funded_amount><paid_amount>775</paid_amount><image><id>583375</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Embroidery</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>To

Now Rustam is requesting a loan from IMON International to purchase more calves to raise. Their eventual sale will yield additional profits that will used to support his family.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;More about Tajikistan and IMON International&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great&apos;s rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;IMON&apos;s History&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International&apos;s clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 42 years old. Garciano is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Garciano owns &amp; operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Garciano has been engaged in his business for over 13 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Garciano joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Garciano is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Garciano from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand the business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Emma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Emma is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory &amp; working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Emma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve/expand the business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About HSPFI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;HSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Nasira has spent most of her life in Multan. She is married to D. A. who runs a business making and selling bedsheets.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has given birth to five children, four sons and a daughter. Her daughter is illiterate while her eldest son also left his education after 8th standard (grade). They both have started doing work to financially support the family. Her daughter does embroidery and her son works in a factory. Nasira’s younger children are getting their education.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nasira also does embroidery work for her neighborhood clients. She wants to expand business for herself and her daughter, so that’s why she has applied for a loan from Asasah.  This is the first time she is getting a loan from any MFI. With the loan amount she will buy embroidery material such as clothing, beads and colored thread in bulk which will help them to complete more embroidered dresses and for generating good profit on it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She hopes that this investment will be profitable for both of them and they will be able to improve the financial conditions of their family.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>775</funded_amount><paid_amount>775</paid_amount><image><id>583385</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Embroidery</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Purchase

women&apos;s suits, wedding gowns and more for 20 years in Buyanja town. This determined and innovative lady has by all standards tried to maintain the business that she started with little capital when she was a housewife. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her main business limitation is having a small stock of clothing, so she is requesting this loan to purchase a greater variety of garments that will attract more customers. The additional profits from an expanded line will enable her to meet her family&apos;s expenses as she considers starting up a poultry business. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sharotte belongs to a

She will use the loan to open a new clothing shop of her own to improve her income and her parent’s living standard.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Wafaa is well-known in her area. She believes her business will be visited by many neighbors and relatives in addition to passersby who will find the good quality of product she has. She hopes to own a bigger boutique in the future.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>583401</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

She lives with her husband in the province of Antique in the Philippines.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;For almost four years, Angelita has been engaged in hog fattening. She is hard-working, determined, and dedicated. She would like to receive a loan to purchase additional piglets, feeds, vitamins and other supplies.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As a very active member since 2007 of Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), a Kiva microfinance partner in the Philippines, Angelita has been a model member, demonstrating regular attendance at weekly meetings and steady repayments on previous loans. With the help of ASHI, she has already funded the college education of three of her children.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Angelita’s dream is for her other children to complete college. Additionally, she hopes to continue her hog-fattening business as a sustainable livelihood to support her family, to reach her goals in life, and to have a happy

in economic, lucrative business terms and of anything that can earn her a profit. A. Getrude, aged 53 years, is a happily married lady of five children and has been in the produce business for over twenty years. She grows food crops like beans, maize, coffee and bananas in Buyanja, Rukungiri, which has always earned her 300,000 Ugandan shillings on a monthly basis.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This loan is to help Getrude purchase manure for her plantation as she looks at diversifying her business.  This is because she did not have sound capital at the beginning. This will give her a free ticket to earn more revenue and cater for her family’s basic needs and also acquire a self-sustaining life as she hopes to open up a big supplies store to sell her produce.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1650</funded_amount><paid_amount>1650</paid_amount><image><id>582933</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

This loan will be her 4th from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. &#10;&#10;&#10;About HSPFI:&#10;HSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.&#10;&#10;&#10; *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has repaid the whole amount of the loan she received, and the small profit she earned has been added to her husband’s income from being a fisherman. With that, she has been able to pay for the education of her only son as well as for their other basic needs, allowing them to enjoy life in a simple way.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ginalyn would like to request a larger loan for the sustainability and growth of her previous business as well as for her new venture -- buying and selling fish. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ginalyn is determined to improve her business as well as the life of her family. Knowing that she can access financial support through loans has given her courage and faith that someday, her child will graduate from college and be ready to face his own life.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ginalyn’s business has been very helpful in achieving her family&apos;s dreams.

She resides in a city called Multan, which is famous for its history, in Pakistan. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has raised a son and a daughter and made them qualified in their own fields. Her son is involved in making and selling bed sheets. He got full training from one of the bed-sheets production factories and now he uses his skills for his own business. Her daughter has received training in embroidery skills from her. She and Amna now help each other in preparing embroidered dresses to complete orders of the customers. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her husband, 58 years of age, is a driver by trade. He drives a rickshaw (a three-wheeled motor vehicle) and works hard to put three meals on the table of his family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They all are very hardworking people. They all make effort in improving their financial condition and the living standard of their family as well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Amna is in her third loan cycle with Asasah. In the previous two loans, she maintained good credit behavior and never missed a meeting. This time, she has applied for a loan for her embroidery business. With the loan amount, she will buy embroidery materials, such as cloth, beads and colored thread, in bulk and make improvements to her business.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>583418</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Embroidery</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Purchase

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Tasleem is 35 years old and married with four children. She resides in a city called Multan, which is famous for its history, in Pakistan. She is an uneducated lady who couldn’t study because her parents were not in a position to afford her education expenses, but she has a God-gifted talent hidden inside, which she knew when she got involved in the business of embroidering dresses.&#13;&#10;  &#13;&#10;She steadily grew her business and her customers acknowledge her skills. She started preparing embroidered dresses for her relatives first, but later on she introduced her skills to her neighbors as well and they are now her good customers. She has been doing this work for over 10 years. She has a talent of making any embroidered art she sees the first time and making it her own. She generates approximately 5000 Pakistan rupees from her business, which helps her to pay for the utilities.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Her husband&apos;s name is M. S.. He has been involved in a dairy business for past 10 years. He has a buffalo at his home and gets milk from her and sells it to different milk shops.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tasleem is in her fourth loan cycle with Asasah. She has maintained good credit behavior in the past three years and never missed a meeting. In this year, she has applied for a loan for her husband. With the loan amount, he will buy another buffalo, which will help him increase his milk-selling business.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1125</funded_amount><paid_amount>1125</paid_amount><image><id>583423</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Dairy</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Purchase

She is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Mary Jane owns &amp; operates a general retail store.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap &amp; toothpaste to the local community. Mary Jane has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2010, Mary Jane joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary Jane is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her store&apos;s product offering. This loan will be Mary Jane&apos;s 1st loan from ASKI. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About ASKI:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva
