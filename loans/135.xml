Desde trabajar como empleada doméstica hasta salir a vender mercaderías varias de puerta en puerta.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Su esposo se dedica a la agricultura, principalmente al cultivo de frutillas y tomates, dependiendo de la temporada.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Hoy día Cándida atiende su despensa y también posee una cantina que funciona en una pequeña escuela rural que queda a pasos de su casa, donde se traslada todos los días para vender sus productos en horas del receso para luego volver a su domicilio.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Desea surtir mejor su negocio para ganar una mayor cantidad de clientela y de esa manera hacer que sus ingresos aumenten día tras día. Es por eso que en esta oportunidad recurre a un préstamo con el fin de llevar a cabo su proyecto.&lt;p&gt;</es><en>Cándida is a hard-working and sacrificing 49 year old woman.

She goes everyday to sell her products during recess and then returns home.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She wishes to better stock her business in order to have a larger customer base and in this way increase her earning day after day. Therefore she is asking for a loan to carry out this project.&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva

Robiyajon is 50 years old. She is married with four children. Robiyajon has always had a trying life. Supporting the large family was very difficult for her husband, that’s why she decided to start her own business.

Thanks to this activity she could fight to provide for her family and educate her children, who today are working adults thanks to her example.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Today this friendly woman is requesting a loan of US$600 for the term of nine months.

Zahrojon is 55 years old. She’s married with four children. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The difficult circumstances and hardships in her life have made her recognize the value of work from a very young age. For about 5 years, she and her husband (who appears in the photo) have been purchasing the young cattle in the local market, fattening them, and selling them. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Zahrojon is a hard-working woman who has fought to provide for her family and to educate her children, who are working adults, thanks to her example. She works with a strength worthy of immense admiration. Mrs. Zahrojon wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and selling them at the best price in the local market. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Now she is requesting a loan of $600 USD for 9 months to buy calves to expand her business. Let’s support this brave woman who has a lot of courage and strength to live. Your generosity can change her

For the past 7 years, she has been baking  “lepeshka,” the national Tajik bread. Musalamkhon works hard to earn an honest living. She gets up early and bakes lepeshka so that people have the fresh bread on their tables for breakfast. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Initially, Musalamkhon only baked the lepeshka, but never sold it herself. Gradually, the business expanded, her children grew up and, today, it is a family business that includes her adult children and a trading place in the market.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Today, Musalamkhon requests 2000 Somoni ($600 USD) in order to purchase flour and firewood for baking the lepeshka. She would like to ensure that she is ready to repay the loan in 10 months. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Thanks to everyone for trusting and supporting her.

He earns about 700 KM (Bosnia-Herzergovina Marks; about $520 USD), but it is not enough for living, especially because they have no house and they must build one. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;So, Suvada is busy in the field trying to earn more for their living. She is busy with farming and now is the right time to sow the fields. But Suvada has no money to buy seeds and she like to avoid planting in the autumn. So she has decided to take a loan of 1500 KM (about $1125 USD) from Women for Women International. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Suvada hopes that she will have good products next year and that she will be able to sell a lot of her vegetables. She will use all of her profits to build her house, because her biggest wish is to have her own

Help Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>This group is called God Help. It members include Kadiatu K. (left) and Charles B.. They have businesses in Makeni. They have been receiving loans from SMT for more than two years now. Through these loans they get from Kiva (through SMT), these entrepreneurs are able to remain in business and sustain themselves. However, they still need new loans to enable them to enhance their businesses. They are thus requesting a loan of Le 1,600,000. Kadiatu, 37, is the leader of the group. She was born in Magoreh village, seven miles from Makeni. She is married and has five children. Her husband is also a businessman. Kadiatu has sold dried fish for the past 10 years. She buys fish in a village called Tombo which is about 10 miles from Freetown. With this loan, Kadiatu is expecting an increase in her profits, which will enable her to provide better for her children.  One of the great challenges Kadiatu faces as a dried fish seller is that they sometimes unknowingly buy a basket of fish that is mixed with some rotten ones. And when this happens, they have to throw away the rotten fish, which causes losses in her business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>208301</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fish

She has a store in the local bazaar where she sells home supplies, such as as kettles, tea trays, and kitchen clocks. She tries very hard to meet her family&apos;s needs, because it is very hard to keep such a large family. Her husband helps by purchasing new supplies, which he brings from Baku every week. She dreams of providing a good education for her children. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Gulnare has applied for a loan of $1200 USD to purchase more supplies and increase her income.

She lives in the village of Lipac near Doboj. She has two children. Unfortunately, her husband died last year. He had supported their family, and they now live on his retirement of 150 KM ($112 USD). Fortunately, Daliborka has her garden and a field where she grows different kinds of vegetables, some of which she uses to feed her family and the rest she sells. Daliborka wants to produce more vegetables for selling, so she decided to take out her first loan from Women for Women International in the amount of 600 KM ($450 USD). She will use this loan to buy seeds for autumn sowing. Daliborka hopes that she will be able to earn enough money to pay all her family’s expenses.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>208308</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>These are Alimany B. and Zainab B..  (Other members of the group are now receiving loans from SMT as individual clients.) They named their group Rhoda. They have been with SMT for over five years now. Their previous loan with SMT was Le 1,000,000.00. This loan was a great help to these entrepreneurs. These people&apos;s businesses have been growing as a result of the continuous access to loans they have been getting from SMT. But they still need new loans as they are aware of the fact that it is the continuous access to financial services that can eradicate or reduce poverty. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Alimany B. is the leader of this group. Alimany owns a provisions shop at Pamlap, a village around the outskirts of Makeni. He has been in his current business for over 15 years now. Alimany was born in Binkolo, a village 7 miles from Makeni. He is 47, married with 4 children. Two of his children are in secondary school and the other two are in primary school. His previous loans with SMT helped Alimany a great deal. Out of the proceeds of his business, he was able to solve his numerous problems. He could send his children to school, attend to them when they fall sick, feed and clothe them. Though he faces some few challenges in his business, like that of bad debtors,  Alimany is nevertheless expecting a lot of improvements in his life with this new loan. His immediate goal he told me is to start building himself and his family a house. Even if he can not accomplish this desire now, he continued, with continuous loans from SMT, Alimany is optimistic that he will be able to accomplish his goal.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>208313</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

des quartiers de la ville de koutiala(troisième région administrative de la république du Mali)&#13;&#10;N’ayant jamais été à l’école comme la plupart des femmes de son âge, Madame Assitan Sidibé fut initiée aux activités commerciales depuis sa tendre enfance par sa mère. Evoluant dans le secteur de la nourriture, notamment la vente de la pâte d’arachide, elle a un grand sens des affaires grâce à une trentaine d’année expérience accumulée dans l’exercice de cette activité. Pour obtenir de la pâte d’arachide, les graines d’arachides sont triées, grillées dans un four (très souvant frabriqué localement), épluchées, vannées puis amenées au moulin (pour avoir la pâte). La pâte ainsi obtenue est mise dans des seaux en plastiques.&#13;&#10;Pour élargir son activité Assitan Sidibé decida d’intégrer le programme crédit de Soro Yiriwaso il ya de cela  4 ans. Après 4 prêts solidaires (prêt de groupe) tous correctement remboursés ; elle est à son troisième prêt individuel.&#13;&#10;Elle compte utiliser ce prêt pour acheter, 1.000 kg d’arachides et  50 seaux en plastique (pour le conditionnement de sa pâte d’arachide). Elle s’approvisionne sur place à Koutiala auprès des commerçants grossistes faisant le stockage des céréales. Elle vend sa production en détail, au comptant et à crédit à son domicile et dans les différents services à une clientèle généralement composée de femmes (ménagères et revendeuses) et de salariés. Son  cycle d’activité (achat, transformation et vente) est d’un mois.&#13;&#10;En raison de la qualité de sa pâte d’arachide, Madame Assitan Sidibé jouit d’une grande réputation dans cette activité de transformation des graines d’arachide en pâte. Elle reçoit beaucoup de commandes surtout auprès des revendeurs et des familles désireuses de faire un stock afin de palier  aux fluctuations de prix.&#13;&#10;Elle compte réaliser un bénéfice de 90.000FCFA par mois qu’elle envisage utiliser pour rembourser les intérêts du prêt et participer aux dépenses quotidiennes de la famille.Dans l’avenir , elle ambitionne ouvrir une boutique afin de faire le grosssiste dans la vente de la pâte d’arachide.</fr><en>Ms. Assitan Sidibé is 50 years old and lives with her seven children and her husband in a nuclear family in Sogomougou, one of the districts of the city of Koutiala (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Never having gone to school, as is true for most women of her age, she was initiated into commercial work at a tender age by her mother.  Developing in the food sector, notably in selling peanut butter, she has much business sense, thanks to 30 years of experience accumulated through doing this work. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To obtain peanut butter, the peanuts are sorted, roasted in an oven (very often built locally), peeled, winnowed, and then taken to the mill (for converting into a paste). The peanut butter obtained in this way is then put into plastic buckets.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To expand her business, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program four years ago. After four solidarity loans (group loans) that were all correctly repaid, she is on her third individual loan. She intends to use this loan to buy 1,000 kg of peanuts and 50 plastic buckets (for conditioning the peanut butter). She gets her supplies locally in Koutiala from wholesale merchants who stock grains. She sells her production at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, out of her home and with the difference public services, to customers generally composed of women (housewives and retailers) and salaried workers. Her business cycle (purchasing, production, and sales) is one month in length.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because of the quality of her peanut butter, Ms. Assitan Sidibé enjoys a great reputation in this business of making peanut butter.  She receives many orders, especially from retailers and from families wanting to stock up against price fluctuations. She intends to realize a profit of 90,000 francs per month that she envisions using for covering the loan interest and for helping with the day-to-day expenses of the family. In the future, her ambition is to open a shop to become a peanut butter wholesaler. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She quickly dedicated herself to profitable activities, in particular the sale of party items such as earrings.  She also sells key chains, clothing and shoes. She has set up a stall at Ségou’s daily Château market (located in the center of town on the main road linking Bamako to Burkina). Wishing to expand her business, she decided to work with the Soro Yiriwaso loan program three years ago now.  Having successfully repaid four group loans (solidarity loans) with an association from her district, she is now on her second individual loan. She plans to use this loan to buy 8 packets of earrings (labeled as being guaranteed to come from Dubai) and 300 pairs of shoes from wholesalers who specialize in women’s items in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali). Mrs. Dejénébou’s merchandise is laid out on a table and generally sold for cash to a clientele made up of men and women. She expects to make a monthly profit of CFA 40,000 and her ambition is to build a home for herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva

Célibataire avec un enfant, elle vit dans le quartier lafiabougou à Selingué (une des sous préfecture de Yanfolila troisième région administrative du Mali). Dès son jeune âge, elle démarre une activité génératrice de revenus notamment la vente de produits cosmétique. Malgré son courage et sa volonté de réussite, elle est rapidement confrontée à un problème de ressources financières. Pour résoudre cette difficulté, elle intégra un groupe de prêt solidaire de l’institution Soro Yiriwaso depuis maintenant trois (3) ans. Avec l’augmentation rapide de son commerce et de sa clientèle, elle passa au prêt individuel et est à son quatrième prêt. Sa boutique est située au bord de la route principale de Selingué et est bien achalandée. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elle compte acheter avec ce prêt beaucoup de flacons de parfum, de perruques et autres articles de beauté de femme pour anticiper les grosses ventes liées à la fête de ramadan et la rentrée scolaire. Elle s’approvisionne à Bamako une fois par mois et vend à selingué dans son magasin au comptant et à crédit à une clientèle composée de femmes de selingué et celles des localités environnantes. Elle jouit d’une bonne réputation en raison de son expérience et de la maîtrise des techniques de commerce.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elle envisage réaliser un bénéfice mensuel de 95.000 FCFA qu’elle utilisera pour augmenter son fonds de commerce et désire à la longue instaurer un salon de coiffure qui est une demande pressante de sa clientèle.</fr><en>Miss Massaran D., 32, is single and has one child. She lives in the Lafiabougou district in Selingué (one of the sous-prefectures of Yanfolila, third administrative region of Mali). Since her youth, she began earning money, notably by selling cosmetics. Despite her courage and will to succeed, she quickly ran into financial difficulties. To solve this problem, she joined in a group loan through Soro Yiriwaso 3 years ago.  As her business and her clientele grew rapidly, she moved on to requesting an individual loan and is presently on her fourth loan. Her little shop is located on the main road of Selingué and is well-patronized. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan she intends to buy a lot of bottles of perfume, wigs, and other beauty products so as to be ready for the increased sales around Ramadan and the new school year. She does her buying in Bamako once a month and makes her sales in Selingué in her shop, for cash or credit, to a clientele composed of the women of Selingué and those coming from surrounding towns. She has a good reputation because of her experience and mastery of her business. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She expects to make a monthly profit of 95,000F CFA which she will use to increase her working capital and she would like to start up a beauty salon which is a pressing need for her clientele. &#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

She is married and has two children, ages 4 and 1. Remza lives with her family in  Mahmutovićima near Kalesija. Her husband has constant work but he doesn`t earn much, only about 450 KM (~ $330 USD). It is not enough to pay all costs for his family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Remza and his husband are busy with farming. They produce several kinds of vegetables and they have a corn field so they can produce food for their cattle. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Remza has borrowed from Women for Women International several times in the past. Every time that she has taken a loan, she invests the proceeds in her business, as she will this time. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has saved some money, but not enough to buy another cow, so Remza will use this loan of 1000 KM ($750 USD) to buy a cow. In this way Remza`s family will be able to improve their living conditions.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>208350</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

She lives with her husband and children in a monogamous family in the Médine district of Ségou (fourth administrative region of Mali).  From her earliest years, she devoted herself to income-generating work to assist her parents in supporting her family.  Once she became of age, she opted at the age of 15 to do commerce in lumber.  Settled in at the Médine marketplace on one of the busiest boulevards in town, and being the only woman busy selling lumber, Ms. Hawa T. is a focus of curiosity and unusual fame in Ségou.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In order to better stand up to the competition, in a sector dominated by men, she decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso three years ago.  She is on her second individual loan, after having settled four group loans (solidarity loans), which were all correctly repaid.  She intends to use this loan to buy 1,500 pieces of lumber in Zantiguila (one of the marketplaces for lumber located on the edge of a closed forest) from woodsmen traders authorized by the government of Mali.  With customers made up exclusively of wholesalers from big cities, Ms. Hawa T. generally makes her sales in cash and rarely on credit.  She envisions realizing a profit per cycle (lasting four weeks on average) of 100,000 francs which enables her to come to the aid of her elderly mother  &#13;&#10;&lt;br

They live in monogamous households, all residing in the Filabougou quarter of Ouelessebougou (Koulikoro, Mali).  They are known to one another by ties of kinship and proximity.  The group’s primary area of endeavor is the sale of fruit and seasonal non-alcoholic carbonated beverages; in addition, they sell a variety of other items, including charcoal and infant clothing (shoes and layettes).  After a series of individual setbacks, they formed a group to join the Soro Yiriwaso group loan program and this will be their first loan.  With this loan of approximately $55 (25,000 XOF) per member, they intend to buy 150 kilograms of fruit, 60 cans of drinks and various other articles.  They do their purchasing from local wholesalers every 15 days and engage in traveling and cash sales.  The women in the Benkadi group hope to realize a profit of $17 (8,000 XOF) each every two weeks.  They will use these profits to meet the needs of their families.  In the days to come they want to diversify their business, branching out into the sale of vegetables and seasonings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from French by Joyce K., Kiva

She will repay the loan in six months.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>650</funded_amount><paid_amount>650</paid_amount><image><id>208365</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Buy ingredients to make tortillas</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Pedro Escobedo, Querétaro</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>23 -102</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2008-09-29T20:20:25Z</posted_date><loan_amount>650</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maria Dolores</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-13T21:54:06Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>MXN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>7000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>650</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>108.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>108.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>108.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>108.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>108.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>108.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>108.33</amount><local_amount>1166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-17T09:06:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1169.51</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5279897</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>108.33</amount><local_amount>1166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-21T08:53:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1169.51</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9891680</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>108.33</amount><local_amount>1166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-24T08:48:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1169.51</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14814910</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>108.33</amount><local_amount>1166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-15T08:17:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1169.51</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20349740</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>108.33</amount><local_amount>1166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-13T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T08:59:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1169.51</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27037034</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>108.35</amount><local_amount>1166.65</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-13T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T09:36:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1169.48</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35927467</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-09-29T21:54:06Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-05-15T09:36:43Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>67290</id><name>Raquel</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Raquel inició el negocio porque requería de ingresos para mantenerse ella y sus padres.

She and her husband took a trip to León-Moroleón-San Juan of Lakes and bought a variety of merchandise to sell to help pay for household expenditures, since Rosario&apos;s husband has never had a salaried job and has always worked odd jobs. Sometimes, Rosario is the one who has to work to help her son get ahead and pay for household expenditures.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Martina launched her business at the invitiation of a friend, since her husband left her for another woman and no longer helps support the family. She had to see for herself what the best way to care for her children and help them get ahead would be. She decided to start selling jewelry two years ago with the encouragement of a friend.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Hortensia started her business because of some health problems she was having. She was suffering from broncheal asthma, and her blood pressure went up dramatically as a result. She began taking natural remedies and they greatly improved her health. A little over a year ago, she became an independent distributor of these products so that more people can enjoy the benefits of natural remedies.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The three women make up the La Isla (&quot;The Island&quot;) group and are requesting a loan of $850, which they will repay in three months, to buy more merchandise for their businesses. &#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>208370</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Buy merchandise for individual businesses</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Escobedo, N.

She started the business because of necessity, given that she was a single mother and the only means of support for her two children.  For this reason, she decided to work for herself.  She started a little more than five years ago helping an acquaintance with food sales, and she now has her own enterprise. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Blanca started in business to help her husband support their household expenses, since his wages were not enough to cover them.  She started six years ago selling second-hand clothing only to acquaintances but, over time, she has increased her customer base and therefore her sales and orders. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rosa started in business to get ahead, given that her husband’s earnings were not enough to cover their household and child-related expenses.  She started three years ago selling clothing on order, giving small demonstrations at the houses of friends and neighbors or door-to-door.  Now, she has established herself in several of the markets and has increased her sales. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;These women need a loan of $1,125.00 USD, to be repaid over six months, in order to purchase raw materials and merchandise so they can continue with their endeavors.

Arariwa les brinda es haberles dado por primera vez la oportunidad de acceder a un crédito, les enseñan a tener cultura de ahorro y reciben capacitaciones mensualmente.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>3325</funded_amount><paid_amount>3325</paid_amount><image><id>211113</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>The clients use the loan to promote their agricultural and secondary commercial activities / Las socias utilizan el prestamo para la principal actividad la Agricola y actividades secundarias comercio.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Calca - Calca - Cusco</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>-10 -76</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>119</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-15T22:50:43Z</posted_date><loan_amount>3325</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Susana</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-30T07:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>9910.2</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>3325</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-30T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2477.55</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-30T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2477.55</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-30T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2477.55</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2477.55</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>831.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>831.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>831.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>831.25</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>831.25</amount><local_amount>2477.55</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-27T08:13:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2481.28</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5292419</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>831.25</amount><local_amount>2477.55</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-15T14:26:15Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2481.28</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9907655</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>831.25</amount><local_amount>2477.55</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-17T08:52:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2481.28</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14832268</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>831.25</amount><local_amount>2477.55</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-15T09:24:28Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2481.28</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20369260</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-16T23:51:56Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-15T09:24:28Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>67325</id><name>Antonieta</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Antonieta tiene 42 años de edad, es casada y tiene 8 hijos de diferentes edades y nivel de estudios.&#13;&#10;Anteriormente se dedicaba solo a los oficios domésticos, y acompañaba a su esposo en la actividades agrícolas, viendo ella la dificultad de que con los ingresos del esposo no le alcanzaba para cubrir todos los gastos de la familia, logro tener una pequeña crianza y venta de pollos, esto le ha ayudado a darles educación a sus hijos.

Previously, she focused only on domestic duties and accompanied her husband with agricultural activities.  Seeing the difficulty her husband had covering the family&apos;s expenses with his income,  she started a small breeding business and selling chickens.  This has helped to provide her children with an education.  She has also bred pigs and has a dairy cow, which she uses to make cheese.  She also makes and sells tamales, atol (a beverage made from corn flour), and meals. She is a very enterprising person and her husband admires and appreciates the success she has had with her businesses. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She doesn&apos;t have any formal education, but she has succeeded thanks to her effort.

For this reason, he started his business four years ago and he currently distributes sweets, cookies and shortbreads directly to a bakery.

Muhamadjon is a hard-working man who, while continuing to work another job, started his own business as a source of additional income and savings in case of unemployment. He knew many people who purchased cattle, and this motivated him to start his own business ten years ago. Over time, he has increased his cattle sales and he is proud to say that the business has been running well, but he now needs additional capital to expand his business. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Therefore, Muhamadjon is requesting a loan in the amount of $1,000 to purchase additional cattle to sell; more specifically, he will reinvest the loan proceeds and grow the business, as he has been doing. He is offering to repay the loan in 12 months. He and his family thank you very much for the support that you offer them in helping to expand his business and helping them give their children a better quality of

She is married and is the loving mother of 3 children. Her father&apos;s hard-working and demanding nature showed her, from the time she was a little girl, the significant value of work, which has served her well because she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Now, she dedicates herself to raising and selling cattle. With the income she generates from this business, she is able to provide a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and her best friends. Consequently, she is seeking a 12-month loan in the amount of 3,500 Somoni ($1,050) in order to buy more young cattle to later sell when they are fully grown. With this investment, she will be able to substantially grow her earnings and improve her quality of life. Please support this dedicated mother&apos;s

He was born in Loko Masama, a village very close to Lungi and about 70 miles from Makeni. He is now 40 years old and married with three children.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Joseph has over 20 years of experience in the second-hand clothes sales business. With previous loans from Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT) he was able to add to his initial capital. He is now constructing a house that will have five rooms, a parlor and a store. With this current loan he plans to buy two more bales of clothing inventory (each bale costs Le 450,000), as he is expecting increased sales as the Islamic end-of-fasting celebration is getting close. With his increased profits, Joseph plans to see the completion of the house he has begun and to ensure his children receive a good education.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This group -- collectively known as Second Hand Clothes -- has been working with SMT for four years. This will be their fifth loan from SMT. Each time they receive a loan they have been able to expand their businesses, and they are very thankful to Kiva for this support.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1375</funded_amount><paid_amount>1375</paid_amount><image><id>208630</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Aminat B., Fatmata B., Aminata K. and Fatmata K. have all teamed together in a group called Sapolaneh. They have successfully repaid previous loans from Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT) and are now applying for a fourth loan. This, like their previous loans, will help them in improving their businesses and therefore improving the living standards for them and their dependents.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aminata (pictured at left) is the leader for this group. She was born in Mile 91, a small town in the Tonkolili district, north of Sierra Leone. She is 25 years old and married with two children; one child is in primary school and the other is too young to start school.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aminata has been selling cottons for three years. With her previous loan, she was able to buy 15 bales of cottons at a village called Bamoi (at a cost of Le 28,000.00 per bale). With this loan, Aminata will increase the amount of cottons she buys to 25 bales. Her aim now is to buy these cottons from Bamoi at a cheaper rate, and then supply her colleagues here in Makeni. This will allow her to make more of a profit, which, she said, means happiness for her.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1375</funded_amount><paid_amount>1375</paid_amount><image><id>208633</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>The Marian Group is named after the group&apos;s leader. All the members are businesswomen in Makeni, the northern provincial headquarters town. They have been a group with SMT for the past two years now and are now in their fourth cycle. Previously, SMT loaned these women Le 600,000.00 each. This they have repaid successfully, and they are now requesting a new loan. The previous loan made a big difference in their lives, but they still need more loans to further empower themselves in their businesses. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The group leader is Marian C.. Marian was born in Magburaka, Tonkolili District, in northern Sierra Leone, 38 years ago. She is married with two school-going children, both of whom are in secondary school. Both she and her husband, who is a businessman, are responsible for their children&apos;s schooling and welfare. Through her groundnut trade, Marian is able to meet most of her financial needs. She has been in the groundnut business for the past 15 years. Marian is doing fine in her business, but she still faces a lot of challenges. First, the amount that SMT&apos;s credit officer approved for her and her group members is not enough. She had wanted Le 1,000,000.00. This would have enabled her to purchase more bags of groundnuts, and as the dry seasoning is fast approaching, she expects a boom in business. Second, sometimes some of the groundnuts within a bag may be rotten, which means some losses for her business. However, with this loan of Le 800,000.00 approved for Marian, she will be able to buy at least three bags of groundnuts to add to her current stock.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1100</funded_amount><paid_amount>1100</paid_amount><image><id>208636</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

They live in the zone with the same name, Gosalvez, in the village of Nuevo Potosí which is an area located on the western slope of the city of La Paz.  This hillside is characterized by having migrants from the high plains region.  In this zone they are generally dedicated to commerce, services and also to production, and most of the members work along these lines. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The communal bank GOSALVEZ has worked with our institution for five cycles, having funded itself on January 10, 2007.  Currently, the group consists of ten members with a management team as follows: &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- President Catalina L.&#13;&#10;- Treasurer Paulina M. Q.&#13;&#10;- Secretary Sofia V. A. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It must be highlighted that the group works with great solidarity, companionship and responsability; they learned how to save within the organization, given that in our country it is very difficult because of the social and economic situation we are going through.  The reasons that motivate them to work with this type of credit, as the women indicate, is that within the association they have a safe haven where they find motivation, fraternization, a space where they feel heard and can talk about their personal issues.  They later leave feeling renewed and able to again face all of their problems. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Catalina L. Condori:  Has as her primary activity sales from a store that is located in her home.  She lives with her husband who earns his wages as a taxi driver.  Since their family does not count on a fixed income, they have turned to loans from the institution and one of this woman’s dreams is to see her children become professionals.  One of them is in sergeant’s school, and the other is still in secondary school. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Agustina M. Q.: Has as her primary activity the sale of lubricants and production of blankets in her own home.  This woman, with effort and sacrifice, works together with her husband to support their four children.  Thanks to the loan granted by the institution, she has been able to buy equipment for making blankets and that way increase her working capital. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Guillermo M. N.: Has his own business making footwear in his own home.  His wife has as her primary activity food sales in the zone of Chijini.  Despite the fact that they both work, their income wasn’t enough to be able to save.  However, with the loan they were granted by the institution they were able to increase their capital and save for their children as they have hope to see them get ahead. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Paulina M. Q.:  Mother of four children, she is an employee of a butcher’s shop.  She earns a minimal wage which did not meet the family’s financial needs, which is why she decided to join her husband in making footwear to offer for sale.  The loan granted by Emprender increased her working capital and, in turn, her production and income which simultaneously helped improve her economic situation. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Juana Sabina T. N.:  Has as her principal activity the making and sale of jackets.  Despite the fact that she is still a single young woman, she is in charge of caring for her parents and brothers and therefore finds herself as the head of household.  Thanks to the loan granted her, she has managed to produce jackets for both men and women of different sizes.  Before, she was lacking in raw materials which was a difficulty.  One of her dreams is to one day have her own store and to be able to export her designs. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sofia V. A.:  Has as her principal activity the sale of undergarments and socks.  Given that she does not count on a fixed wage, her income was not sufficient.  She sought a loan to help her to increase and diversify her products.  Her principal objective is to be able to save so she can buy her own plot of land. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Dominga N. A.:  Dedicates herself to the sale of aprons, and finds herself in charge of supporting her five children.  The only income with which the family can count on is hers, since the children are still in school.  With the loan granted her, it has become a possibility that this woman might be able to buy her own stand and a stock of merchandise. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Teodora Q. Cayo:  Has as her activity the fabrication and sale of footwear, and she also cares for her six children given that the father is in a rural area.  It is for this reason that she assumed the expenses and responsibilities of the home.  Her dream is to be able to have a store and increase her capital, in order to produce her shoes for men, women and children. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Flora R. M.:  This woman has as her principal activity the sale of fruit.  She has a large family, and their income is dependent on her.  With the loan from the institution she has managed to increase her capital, and in that way purchase more seasonal products and improve the financial situation for herself and her children. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Irene C. M.:  This woman works tending to a public restroom, and her husband earns his wages as a chauffer.  The family’s income is minimal, and does not cover their basic needs.  With her loan, she has managed to purchase gifts which she sells in various locales close to her work and in this way try to improve their very difficult economic situation.  &lt;p&gt;

In general, this area of town is devoted to commerce and services, and therefore the majority of bank members fall into this category.  &#13;&#10;The Entrepreneurs Commercial Bank has its roots in the restructuring of God’s Love Commerical Bank.  It was founded on October 3, 2007, and has worked with this field partner through three loan cycles.  Currently the group has ten members.  President Mery Margot A. C., treasurer Cinda G. Bascope, and secretary Pamela Vasquez M. sit on its board of directors.  It should be noted that the group projects solidarity, companionship, and responsibility; those within the association have learnt to save despite encountering setbacks in the last loan cycle. Members do not want to leave the association.  This type of loan in particular motivates the members to work.  The ladies indicate that within their association they find a place that provides relaxation, motivation, and companionship, a setting where they feel heard and can speak of personal problems, a haven from which they can then go forth empowered to once again tackle those problems. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Verónica Erika A. P.’ main business is the sale of tea.  Due to this business and together with her husband’s assistance, Verónica envisions the possibility of being able to support their two children, both of whom are still in school.  Her sole dream of seeing her children become professionals caused her to join the association to be able to expand her business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Cinda G. Bascope currently works in food distribution.  In the past she sold food; however, in order to spend more time with her children she opted for becoming a distributor.

With her first loan of 500.00 PEN, she purchased cookies, soft drinks, candy, and yogurt for her grocery store. From the age of 10, she started working, helping out her paternal aunts. In exchange for her work, she only received provisions and alpaca fleece. When she turned 19, she started to work independently. She used to sell salchimote, Peruvian street food made of maize and sausages, in the city of Juliaca. At 29, she went to live with her husband and ever since then, they raise livestock—cows, sheep, and llamas (for meat). Most of the time she delivers alpacas and llamas by foot to the Bolivians who come to the countryside, and once or twice she delivers meat to retailers in the city of Tacna at an average of 3-5 carcasses. She also pertains to an organization of craftswomen, and they receive orders from Cuzco and Arequipa in agreement with the “Proyecto Sierra Sur” (Southern Sierra Project). &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With this loan of 1,000.00 PEN, which will be repaid in 4 monthly installments, she will purchase more alpacas and llamas to fatten them and sell their meat. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her goal is to have her own grocery store in Mazocruz and to have her children study in Puno. &#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>208777</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Livestock</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Purchase alpacas and llamas to be fattened and sold for meat</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Mazocruz, Puno</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-16.75 -69.733333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>72</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-01T22:30:36Z</posted_date><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Barbara Herma</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-15T23:50:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-16T07:56:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5330976</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T00:48:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9951346</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T13:43:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10224373</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T19:47:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20417103</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-01T23:50:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T19:47:26Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>67431</id><name>Claudia</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Claudia tiene 43 años de edad, estudió primaria completa, es casada y progenitora de tres hijas de 22 años (casada) 18 y 16 años de edad (solteras).

Generally, she delivers 20 to 30 butchered animals per week to the wholesalers in the city of Tacna. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan of 1,000.00 soles, to be repaid in four installments, she will buy five alpacas who will be delivered as meat to the wholesalers. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her goal is to export alpaca meat given the demand for it outside the country, and she also hopes to see her daughter finish her education and become a professional. &lt;p&gt;   &#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>208791</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Animal Sales</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Purchase of five alpacas.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Mazocruz, Puno</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-16.75 -69.733333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>72</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-10T02:10:18Z</posted_date><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Dina Isabel</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-24T02:39:58Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-23T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-16T07:56:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5330982</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-23T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T00:53:29Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9951352</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-23T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T13:48:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10224379</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-23T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T19:50:04Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20417107</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-10T02:39:58Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T19:50:04Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>67441</id><name>Dionicia Timotea</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Dionicia tiene 51 años D. edad, estudió primer año D. primaria, es casada, madre D. siete hijos.

Unfortunately, two of her children passed away and only her one son lives, who is 21 years old. She lives in Centro Poblado de Imicate, in the province of Yunguyo, Puno.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Eugenia decided in 2005 to join the community bank &quot;Fe y Alegría&quot; (Faith and Happiness) of Yunguyo to increase her capital. With her initial loan for 300 Soles, she increased capital and bought one head of cattle livestock.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Doña Eugenia says that from age eight to fifteen she worked as a maid. With capital saved, she began to sell vegetables in the city of Yunguyo. When she was twenty, she found her husband and they both dedicated themselves to purchasing and selling cattle and manure. Since then, she has sold four heads of cattle that she raised.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan for 2000 Soles, which will be paid back in four months, she will buy one head of cattle, worth 2000 Soles, in order to fatten it up.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her dreams are to buy a truck, which will be used for her business, and for her son to continue studying to become a professional.&lt;br

Por falta de medios económicos no pudo estudiar porque tenía que ayudar a su madre en el cuidado y crianza del ganado vacuno y ovinos. A los 20 años de edad se fue a trabajar de empleada a la ciudad de Ilo, regresó al campo a los 28 años de edad debido a que su madre se encontraba mal de salud y llegó a fallecer. Formó su hogar a los 30 años de edad, lamentablemente su pareja la abandonó cuando su hijo tenia apenas 03 meses de nacido, desde entonces ella asumió el rol de padre y madre, sólo educó a su hijo hasta quinto de secundaria, el se fue a trabajar a la ciudad de Lima y hasta la fecha es quien la apoya económicamente.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Su sueño es comprar más ganado vacuno para engorde y tener un pequeño establo.</es><en>Filomena was born on August 11, 1952. She didn’t go to school, she only attended a reading program. She is separated and has a 21 year old son. She lives in Centro Poblado of Acari in the district and province of Yunguyo, Puno.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is one of the older members of the Communal Bank “Fe y Alegria” (Faith and Happiness) in Yunguyo, she has been a member for 4 years and left for family reasons, returning recently to the Communal Bank.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan for S/.500 Nuevos Soles, which will be repaid in 4 payments, she will increase her capital to buy 1 head of cattle to fatten. With S/.800 she will fatten pigs and sheep which she will sell in the Yunguyo market.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Filomena lost her father when she was 8 years old, and she is one of 6 children. Her mother had to take responsibility to raise the children alone and move forward.  For lack of economic means she could study because she had to help her mother care for and raise cattle and sheep. At 20 years old she went to work in the city of Ilo, returned to the countryside at 28 years old as her mother was in ill health and later passed away. She married at 30 years old, sadly her husband abandoned her when her son was only 3 months old. Since then she has assumed the role of father and mother, educating her son through the 5th year of secondary school, then he went to work in Lima and today it is he who supports her economically.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her dream is to buy more cattle to fatten and have a small stable.&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva

Both her children have families now. Francisca studied through the beginning of high school and she lives in the Jr. Puno s/n in the Mazocruz district, El Collao province, Puno.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Francisca is a partner in the “Generation 2000” Communal Bank in Mazocruz. Four years ago she lacked capital, and decided to join the communal bank. Her first loan was for 300 soles, and she used it to buy cookies, sodas, caramels, etc. Francisca started helping her mother at the age of eight, and at age twelve she began to work on her own. She bought fruit in Desaguadero and brought it to Mazocruz to sell. When she was 28 years old she separated from her husband, the father of her children. She started to sell alpaca, llama, and sheep meat, which she brings directly from the city of Tanca.  Francisca sells 20 to 30 animals weekly. Parallel to this business she also has a grocery store that she built 28 years ago. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With a loan of 1,500 soles, Francisca will buy: 2 bags of rice for 300 soles, 2 bags of sugar for 156 soles, 1 box of oil for 80 soles, 3 bags of noodles for 90 soles, and with the rest she’ll buy sodas, cookies and other goods. Francisca will repay the loan in four months.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Francisca’s goal is to build a house close to the binational highway to the Moquegua department, with a grocery store and a restaurant. &#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>525</funded_amount><paid_amount>525</paid_amount><image><id>208812</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>She will buy rice, sugar, oil, noodles, etc.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Mazocruz, Puno</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-16.75 -69.733333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>72</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-06T01:40:26Z</posted_date><loan_amount>525</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Francisca</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-20T04:54:48Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>525</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-19T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>375</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-19T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>375</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-19T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>375</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-19T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>375</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>131.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>131.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>131.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>131.25</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>131.25</amount><local_amount>375</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-19T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-16T07:57:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>391.12</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5330992</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>131.25</amount><local_amount>375</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-19T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T00:51:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>391.12</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9951362</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>131.25</amount><local_amount>375</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-19T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T13:46:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>391.12</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10224389</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>131.25</amount><local_amount>375</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-19T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T19:48:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>391.12</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20417116</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-06T04:54:48Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T19:48:54Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>67455</id><name>Gabriela Angelica</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Gabriela tiene 32 años de edad, estudió secundaria completa, es conviviente y madre de dos hijos (un varón de 06 años y una mujer de 02 años de edad).

Also, she sold vegetables in Conduriri, together with her husband. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan of 1,000 Nuevos Soles, which she will pay back in 4 payments, she will buy four boxes of cookies for S/ .160, 5 boxes of chocolates for S/.100, 10 bags of caramels for S/.100 and more, with which she will sell to the key city, in Mazocruz. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her dream is to put a grocery store in Mazocruz and that her daughter will study.  &#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Brittany Thatcher, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>208838</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To buy cookies, chocolates, caramels, etc. </use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Mazocruz, Puno</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-16.75 -69.733333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>72</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-16T19:10:43Z</posted_date><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Lorenza</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-30T19:36:58Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-30T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-30T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-30T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-16T07:57:20Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5331001</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T00:55:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9951371</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T13:49:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10224398</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>87.5</amount><local_amount>250</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-18T08:07:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20417123</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-16T19:36:58Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-18T08:07:06Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>67476</id><name>María Francisca</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>&lt;div align=&apos;justify&apos;&gt;&#13;&#10; La señora Maria Francisca M. es originaria del municipio de Ciudad Sandino en la ciudad de Managua.

The group is going through its 9th cycle of the program for women.  Chipas is a traditional food for our country and it is very popular for consumers.  Caaupe is a city that is traditionally known as a place where you can enjoy some of the best Chipas.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of the 15 women, 13 sell Chipas, one has a butcher shop and the other sells clothing. They are all neighbours in the region of Gral. Diaz in the city of Caaupe.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With the loans that were acquired through the organization &quot;Fundacion&quot; they purchase ingredients to make Chipas. This time they saw great success in acquiring their ingredients because they all got together and they purchased in great quantities at wholesale prices, granting them significant savigns.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All of the members receive on average 973,000 gs. and they use the funds to invest in the production of their products, as described here above.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All of the members of the committee wish to thank the organization &quot;Fundacion&quot; for the support and for allowing them to be part of the women&apos;s program. Currently the committee has an objective to achieve greater sales in these months up to December 8, which is the Patron celebration of Caaupe.

With her first loan, she started purchasing wool from sheep, alpaca and llama to sell in Mazocruz. Little by little, she increased her capital and changed her business, and now she sells children&apos;s clothing and sometimes will sell snacks from her motocart at a local school With the current loan she is requesting, which she plans to repay in four months, she will purchase five packages of children&apos;s clothing and use the remainder to buy snacks. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&quot;Thanks to the community bank I started to dedicate myself to the business.

She lives on Tacna Avenue in Mazocrux, Peru. Modesta is a new member of the Generation 2000 Community Bank. She decided to join because she lacked capital and for the ability to receive a loan. With the loan she is requesting, which she plans to repay within four months, she will purchase one sack of rice, one sack of sugar, one sack of noodles, one package of soft drinks, among other items. Modesta tells us that she does not know her parents, who left her when she was three years. Her mother left her with a childless single mother. There she grew up, dedicating herself to kitchen chores, washing, grazing cattle, etc., until she and her partner started a business buying and selling alpaca meat in Mazocruz at retail. Three years ago she set up a convenience store and from 2006 she also has prepared meals on market days (Fridays and Saturday).

She&apos;s married and a mother of two boys, ages 5 and 3. She lives on Tacna Avenue in the town of Mazocruz. In 2002, she decided to join the Generation 2000 Community Bank, and with her initial loan she purchased outfits for infants, jackets, and wool pants. Teresa was orphaned at age 12, and the next year she started selling gelatins. When she turned 21, she started a family and began selling clothes, making sweaters and cloths for TVs. She purchased her supplies in the city of Juliaca and sold them in the city of Puno. Two years ago she changed her business, and currently tends to her restaurant. With the loan, which she plans to repay in four months, she will purchase two heads of cattle to fatten. Her goal is to purchase a home in Puno and to set up a snack bar so she can provide for her sons&apos; education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>208869</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase two heads of cattle to fatten</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Mazocruz, Puno</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-16.75 -69.733333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>72</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-16T02:50:23Z</posted_date><loan_amount>750</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Teresa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-30T12:55:58Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>2200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>750</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-30T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>550</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-30T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>550</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-30T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>550</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>550</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>187.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>187.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>187.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>187.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>187.5</amount><local_amount>550</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-16T07:57:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>558.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5331010</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>187.5</amount><local_amount>550</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T00:55:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>558.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9951380</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>187.5</amount><local_amount>550</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T13:49:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>558.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10224407</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>187.5</amount><local_amount>550</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-18T08:07:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>558.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20417130</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-16T12:55:58Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-18T08:07:08Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>67499</id><name>Reyna Gloria</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Reyna inicio el negocio para poder ayudar a su esposo por que  lo que gana es muy poco y no les alcanza.

A los 22 años de edad formó su hogar y continuó con el negocio, además vendía carne de chancho en la ciudad de Puno.

She studied at the Superior Técnico [Advanced Technical Institute]. She is married and the mother of five children (four girls ages 12, 18, 3 and 2 months, and one 8-year-old boy).  She lives in the village of Acari, in Yunguyo district and province, in the region of Puno.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tereza became a member of the &quot;Fe y Alegría&quot; [Faith and Joy] Community Bank in 2000. She first received a loan of 300 soles [about US$100], which she then used to purchase two bags of ají [Peruvian hot peppers]. She started working in this business when she was 16 years old, selling beans, potatoes, chuño [potato flour], tunta [dehydrated potato], and quinoa, in the city of Juliaca. When she was 22, she built her own house and continued operating her business while also selling pork in the city of Puno.  Three years ago she changed her business and now sells ají brought from the Tacna region (Sama district) and sold each week in Desaguadero.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan of 3,000 soles [about US$1,025] -- which will be paid back in four installments -- Tereza plans to buy 4 bags of ají, which she will sell in the city of Desaguadero.  Each bag costs 430 soles.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tereza&apos;s goal is to buy a small truck to help her run her business. She also hopes her son will be able to study in the city of Tacna, seeing she recently has purchased land and soon will build her house to be able to move her family there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Todd M.

Decidió integrar el Banco Comunal desde hace 05 años porque le faltaba capital para equipar su tienda de abarrotes. Con el crédito inicial de S/.300 Nuevos Soles compró 01 bolsa de arroz, 01 bolsa de azúcar, etc. Desde los 06 años de edad su padre las abandonó y ella tenía que salir a vender gelatina, desde los 09 hasta los 18 años de edad vendía abarrotes en las ferias de Tupala, Huacullani, Huaitiri y otros. A los 19 años de edad convivió con su pareja y ambos instalaron su tienda de abarrotes. Con un capital acumulado actualmente vende combustible, carne de alpaca, llama, ovino y entrega a los mayoristas de Tacna.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Con este crédito de S/.1,500 nuevos soles, el cual será cancelado en 04 cuotas, tiene presupuestado comprar 01 cilindro de combustible con S/.600 y con el resto del capital comprará alpacas para la venta en carne. Cada alpaca tiene un costo de S/.180.00 a S/.200.00.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Su meta es tener una casa muy bonita en Mazocruz, instalar una tienda comercial, contar con empleados para la atención al público y ella sólo lo administraría, además que sus hijos estudien y sean profesionales.</es><en>Yaneth is 25 years old and completed a fourth of secondary school. She is married and mother of three children (two girls who are two and eight years old, and a boy who is four years old). She lives in Jr. Puno, district of Mazocruz, province of El Collao, Puno.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is a member of the community bank &quot;Generación 2000&quot; in Mazocruz. She decided to join the community bank five years ago because she lacked capital to stock her grocery shop. With the initial credit of 300 Soles, she bought one bag of rice, one bag of sugar, etc. At six years of age, her father abandoned her and she had to go out to sell gelatin. From age nine to eighteen, she sold groceries in the markets of Tupala, Huacullani, Huaitiri, and others. At age nineteen she married her husband and they installed their grocery shops. With a capital accumulated, she presently sells fuel, alpaca, llama, and sheep meat, mostly to the wholesalers of Tacna.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan of 1500 Soles, which she will repay in four months, she proposes to buy one cylinder of fuel with 600 Soles and with the rest of the capital she will buy alpacas for the sale of meat. Each alpaca costs 180 to 200 Soles.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her goal is to have a very beautiful home in Mazocruz, set up a commercial shop, hire employees to attend to the public, and she will just administer it. Her goal is also that her kids study and become professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>525</funded_amount><paid_amount>525</paid_amount><image><id>208878</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Buy fuel and alpacas for the cost of meat.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Mazocruz, Puno</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-16.75 -69.733333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>72</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-14T16:40:26Z</posted_date><loan_amount>525</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Yaneth Melania</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-28T22:40:32Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>525</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>375</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>375</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>375</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>375</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>131.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>131.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>131.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>131.25</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>131.25</amount><local_amount>375</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-16T07:57:28Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>391.12</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5331013</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>131.25</amount><local_amount>375</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T00:55:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>391.12</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9951383</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>131.25</amount><local_amount>375</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T13:49:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>391.12</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10224410</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>131.25</amount><local_amount>375</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-18T08:07:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>391.12</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20417133</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-14T22:40:32Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-18T08:07:14Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>67505</id><name>San Pablo Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>En el centro focal Panamericana podemos encontrar a la asociación “San Pablo”  a la fecha cuenta con nueve miembros activos que trabajan junto a Pro-Mujer hace más de siete años. &#13;&#10;Diversos son los negocios de esta asociación  por ejemplo algunas de ellas tienen una mini- distribuidora de perfumes de marca( Reblon), Sonia es dueña de una tienda de abarrotes, Luz al igual que otras de sus compañeras se dedican a la venta de electrodomésticos que por lo general los dejan a crédito a instituciones   y personas particulares.

The main activity of this group is making clothes, which they then sell at the July 16th Market in El Alto.

Various activities exist within the association. For example, some are dedicated to the construction and sales of shoes, and some are dedicated to the weaving of vicuna (a llama-like animal of the central Andes that yields a soft wool) blankets, which they sell in the city markets. To increase their production, they need to buy more raw materials, such as cow leather and vicuna wool for weaving blankets. Their dream is to form a large business that will generate greater incomes for their families and provide work opportunities to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jay

Consiguieron un terreno en el Asentamiento Villa Zulma del Barrio San Antonio de la ciudad de Lambaré.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Ellos trajeron esa idea, de producir papas fritas, y se dispusieron en hacerlo en su propia casa y así fue que empezaron a probar si tenían éxito, les fue bien.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Fue así que la Sra.

She has three children and lives with her partner. Many years ago she went to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she spent all of her childhood. There she began to work in a factory, where she prepared french fries, which were packed and sold in supermarkets. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mara met another Paraguayan in this factory and they first became friends, then partners. They decided to return together to Paraguay. They bought some land in the Villa Zulma settlement in the San Antonio neighborhood in the city of Lambaré. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The pair continued to make french fries, and they tested the market by distributing the fries from their home. This was successful.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was then that Mrs. Mara Luz became a member of the Women with Hope committee in order to increase her sales. Today she fills orders for food stores and supermarkets. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The other members work in the following sectors:&#13;&#10;1.- Silvia  A.

clinic that has been operational for 7 years. Before the clinic, Lawrence was a farmer with mostly matooke and sweet potatoes plantations plus cattle for milk and meat. But as a result of getting a surplus income, he started a clinic that he works in it with his daughter, a nursing assistant. He is married with 8 children and his wife is mostly managing their family farm. Two of his children finished school and are now managing their own families, while 6 are still in school. The loans he gets mostly help with school fees and are partly invested in his farm and clinic. Whenever Lawrence repays his loans, he saves and some time he will be able to use the savings to construct a big family house.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He is now in need of a loan to be able to buy some goats and pigs to keep at home to top up the income he gets from selling milk. He is so grateful for the work of Kiva. When I explained to him what Kiva does, he said it&apos;s unbelievable.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2800</funded_amount><paid_amount>2800</paid_amount><image><id>208977</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Livestock</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Buy some goats and pigs to keep at home.</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Nkokonjeru</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.3 32.033333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>84</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-01T20:21:52Z</posted_date><loan_amount>2800</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Lawrence</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Diriisa</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Zaituni</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Charles</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Livingstone</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Yudaya</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Musoke</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-16T05:35:44Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>UGX</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>4630000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>2800</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1157500</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1157500</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1157500</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-15T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1157500</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>700</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>700</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>700</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>700</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>700</amount><local_amount>1157500</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T04:45:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1162000</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5344369</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>700</amount><local_amount>1157500</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T02:28:04Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1162000</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9966483</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>700</amount><local_amount>1157500</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T14:47:57Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1162000</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14882680</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>700</amount><local_amount>1157500</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-15T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T20:40:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1162000</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20432214</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-02T05:35:44Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T20:40:55Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>67532</id><name>Dembe Lending Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Robinah N. is the leader of Dembe Women&apos;s Group, which has been in existence for 5 years.

The cans are put in a previously dug hole and covered for a week or two and the end result is &lt;i&gt;tonto&lt;/i&gt;. For &lt;i&gt;waragi&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;tonto&lt;/i&gt; is again put into metal cans and placed on a fire with a tube that connects to two more metal cans from which the boiled &lt;i&gt;tonto&lt;/i&gt; moves and is cooled. In a week, Robinah can make and sell 8 jerry cans of &lt;i&gt;tonto&lt;/i&gt; and 7 of &lt;i&gt;waragi&lt;/i&gt; for wholesale as she also sells it to her daily customers that drink it at her home.

This valley has three neighborhoods - Acobamba, Libertad and Progreso and the community is quite charming due to it&apos;s commercial area.

She went into business selling hot drinks.  Now she sells clothing, food and fruit depending on the season.  Before, she could not count on having business capital because she used all of her earnings to feed her children.  Her husband drives a tractor that he rents to institutions.  Now Norma can save for the education of her children who are in college.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Soledad S. is married.  Her business is selling CDs and DVDs.

Comenzó en el mes de Marzo de 2003, vendiendo tortas en una mesita que acondicionó para poder elaborar las torta, el pan y la carne la calentaba en la estufa de su casa, pero poco a poco le empezó a ir mejor y pudo comprar un carrito tortero en buenas condiciones el cual ubicó en el frente de su  casa así como unas mesitas y sillas para que sus clientes pudieran comerse las tortas ahí de manera cómoda.

Because the money he was making wasn&apos;t enough, he would often become desperate.  Because of this she decided to work doing anything she could to make money while at the same time take care of her children.  She started in March 2003 selling sandwiches from a table that she designed to use to make them.  The bread and meat were warmed on the stove in her home but little by little things started going well and she was able to buy a sandwich cart that was in good condition that she put in front of her home in addition to a small table and chairs so that her clients could be more comfortable while they ate their sandwiches.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With her previous credit from Kiva she was able to buy ingredients needed to make the sandwiches and due to the suggestion of several people she now also makes tacos and business has improved.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She needs a loan for US$750 that she will repay in six months to buy ingredients to make sandwiches and tacos so that she will be able to offer better service to her clients.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br

Comenzó en el año 2002, cuando una amiga le hizo unos adornos para la fiesta de cumpleaños de uno de sus hijos y le dijo que porque no se animaba a hacerlos; ella le explicó y comenzó a hacer bolsitas y adornos de navidad. Posteriormente comenzó a elaborar figuras y cajitas de madera para los arreglos con la ayuda de su papá que es carpintero. Desde entonces le ha ido muy bien ya que le hacen pedidos de las escuelas sobre todo en épocas especiales como Navidad, día de las madres, día del niño, etc.  En el 2006 recibió su primer crédito a través de KIVA y desde entonces ha mantenido su negocio y sus clientes han aumentado.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ella necesita un préstamo por US $825 que pagara en 6 meses para comprar materiales que le permitan cumplir con los pedidos que tiene de sus clientes y seguir dándoles un buen servicio.</es><en>Carmen started the business due to the necessity of having an income in addition to that of her husband that would allow them to give a better quality of life to their children.

She began selling food, and later used clothing in the sidewalk of her house, and later she got a place in an open air market, that is in the district where she lives.

children studied.  But at the end of their studies, she had to leave the cafeteria, because you must be a parent of the students of the school in order to be able to have this business.  Because of this, 4 years ago she began with a loan from a sister to sell french fries in order to help herself.  After she couldn’t run the cafeteria, with the experience that she had acquired there she decided to began a mobile snack stand for the afternoons and special events (Civic dates, religious festivals, baseball season, etc.)  Also in the mornings she works as a helper in the cafeteria at the university.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She needs a loan of US $475 that she would repay in 6 months in order to stock

He began in March 2005 making and selling food when his wife suggested participating in a money “Tanda”  to invest it in some chairs and tables on the patio of their home. (A “tanda” is when a group agrees that each member will contribute a quantity of money weekly, biweekly or monthly, and then that sum is distributed to a group member. Each group member will, in turn, receive the sum of money collected).  Since then the business has gone very well for them as they sell food to their colleagues who work who are also drivers and today they have many customers thanks to their children who help them a lot by waiting on tables. Thanks to a previous loan through KIVA, they could invest and attend to some furniture needs that they had as well as restock ingredients to make their meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>375</funded_amount><paid_amount>375</paid_amount><image><id>209201</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Buy ingredients to make food</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Tampico, Tamaulipas</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>22.216667 -97.85</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-05T12:10:15Z</posted_date><loan_amount>375</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Eduardo</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-19T12:28:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>MXN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>4000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>375</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-19T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-19T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-19T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-19T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>93.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>93.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>93.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>93.75</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>93.75</amount><local_amount>1000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-19T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-17T09:06:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1025.6</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5279936</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>93.75</amount><local_amount>1000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-19T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-21T08:54:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1025.6</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9891719</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>93.75</amount><local_amount>1000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-19T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-24T08:49:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1025.6</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14814949</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>93.75</amount><local_amount>1000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-19T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T07:53:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1025.6</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20349771</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-05T12:28:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-03-16T07:53:08Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>67608</id><name>Amalia</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Amalia vende refrescos en un puesto del mercado Bellavista, ella se dedica a esta actividad desde hace mucho tiempo, y gracias a este negocio compró su motocarro, el mismo que es manejado y cuidado por su esposo Hugo, quien es técnico en mecánica de motores pesados.

He is requesting a loan of 3500 Somoni ($1050) for the term of 6 months. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices, and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1050</funded_amount><paid_amount>1050</paid_amount><image><id>209265</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery Store</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase foodstuffs to increase the range of goods for selling</use><location><country_code>TJ</country_code><country>Tajikistan</country><town>Khujand</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>40.28 69.631667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>100</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-02T14:00:29Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1050</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Sherali</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-16T18:41:52Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TJS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>3500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1050</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>583.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>583.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>583.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>583.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>583.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>583.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>175</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>175</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>175</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>175</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>175</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>175</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>175</amount><local_amount>583.33</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-16T06:16:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>596.82</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5323786</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>175</amount><local_amount>583.33</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-15T23:37:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>596.82</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9943644</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>175</amount><local_amount>583.33</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T13:09:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>596.82</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10220710</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>175</amount><local_amount>583.33</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T09:21:47Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>596.82</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20409636</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>175</amount><local_amount>583.33</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T19:34:57Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>596.82</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27102666</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>175</amount><local_amount>583.35</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T20:34:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>596.85</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35996886</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-02T18:41:52Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-05-15T20:34:09Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>67616</id><name>Boginiso</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Boginiso T. is 53 years old.

Village in Kampong Chhnang Province. Mrs. Ly P. is currently a cow middleman who buys cows and then re-sells later at a better price. Since this business is going well, she wants to buy more cows to re-sell. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. Her husband, Mr. Man Yan, assists her in the business. Mrs. Ly P. is 36 years old and the mother of a child who is attending the local school.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;This is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Three members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK&apos;s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia&apos;s poor. These allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK&apos;s clients make their payments on time.

He added everything he learned to the education his parents had instilled in him since he was a child. He plans to keep raising livestock and to acquire even more. This is why he is requesting a loan of 2000 Somoni (600 USD) that will allow him to purchase more fodder for the normal development and competitiveness of his cattle. He promises to repay the loan in 12 months. He thanks all of you who kindly respond to his

consists of eighteen members, who plan to use the loan for different purposes. Mrs. Chek S. is the village bank president, and she is currently a cow breeder who is raising eight cows to sell. Her husband, Mr. Each Sok, owns a small plot of land for cultivating rice. Although Mrs. Chek S. and her husband have different businesses, they still cannot support their family well. In order to improve their living conditions, Mrs. Chek S. decided to ask for a loan to start a new pig breeding business. Mrs. Chek S. is 40 years old and the mother of four children who are all attending the local school. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;(Mr. Tras R. did not come to accept the loan, but his wife did and is present in the picture instead).&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;This village bank loan is an end-of-term loan and all the members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the veR. end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK&apos;s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia&apos;s poor. These allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK&apos;s clients make their payments on time.
