Mas Sen Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>The village bank loan (loan group), which consists of 12 people, is located in Svay Bakav village in Kampong Chhnang province. Mrs. Mas S. is the village bank president who has been selected by the members. She is a farmer who cultivates both rice and vegetables. In rice farming, she now faces a small problem because she wants to cultivate in the dry season; unfortunately, she does not have enough rice seeds for cultivation. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy more rice seeds for her rice plantation during the dry season. Mrs. Mas S. is a widow with a child who is a student in the local school. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;All the members in this village bank loan have end-of-term loans, so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK’s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time. AMK (Kiva&apos;s Field Partner) has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and a default rate of 0% on Kiva.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1050</funded_amount><paid_amount>1050</paid_amount><image><id>248153</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To buy more rice seeds for her rice plantation during the dry season.</use><location><country_code>KH</country_code><country>Cambodia</country><geo><level>country</level><pairs>13 105</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>109</partner_id><posted_date>2009-01-01T08:01:05Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1050</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Mas</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Mas</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Phors</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Mai</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Chit</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>0</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Riem</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>0</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Kas</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Sam</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Khor</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Chhoeurt</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Lyveur</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Samminas</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-12-05T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>KHR</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>4200000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1050</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2009-11-18T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>4200000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2010-01-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1050</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>295</amount><local_amount>1180000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-05-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-06-15T21:00:59Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1188525.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44400022</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-09-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-10-15T12:08:15Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>201445</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>86987271</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>400000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-10-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-11-15T13:16:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>402890</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>96899808</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>605</amount><local_amount>2420000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-11-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-12-15T11:19:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2437484.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>103737782</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2009-01-04T01:38:58Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-12-15T11:19:38Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>81657</id><name>Eit</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mrs. Eit S. is a villager in Takol village in Kampong Chhnang province.

Thmey village in Kampong Chhnang province. Mrs. Arn C. is the village bank president who has been selected by the members. She is a farmer who cultivates both rice and vegetables. In vegetable farming, she now faces a small problem because she does not have enough money to buy bean seeds to grow on the field.  Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy them. Mrs. Arn C. is a 59-year-old widow with two children who both help her on the plantation. Mrs. Bung Y. did not come to take her loan, but her husband did, so he takes her place in the photo.  &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;All the members in this village bank have end-of-term loans, so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK’s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time. AMK (Kiva&apos;s Field Partner) has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and a default rate of 0% on Kiva.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>248159</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To buy bean seeds to grow on the field.</use><location><country_code>KH</country_code><country>Cambodia</country><geo><level>country</level><pairs>13 105</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>109</partner_id><posted_date>2009-01-01T08:01:05Z</posted_date><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Arn</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Lieng</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Phea</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Chheang</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Hak</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Bung</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Vuthy</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Nga</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Yat</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-12-05T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>KHR</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>2700000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2009-08-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2700000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-10-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>675</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>500000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T10:52:42Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>502518.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35941686</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>525</amount><local_amount>2100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-06-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-07-29T07:40:37Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2110578.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>52907886</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-08-05T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-09-15T11:06:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100503.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>73552468</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2009-01-05T06:59:43Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-09-15T11:06:09Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>81660</id><name>Long</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Long S. is a 37 year old resident of Pursat Province.

She is 29 years old and married to Danny. Rosila and her husband only finished high school. Hard work is what they have to do to live a good life, Rosila said.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Armed with the desire to have their own business, they began a fishing business. The couple need a lantern for fishing, which is will provide light in the dark with the use of a battery. They applied for a loan to purchase the lantern. Luckily, Paglaum MPC released the said amount. A portion of the amount will be used to purchase a blinker, which is another fishing accessory, used to attract a good catch of squid. Just like any other business, fishing has its many challenges. When fishing is banned for a period of time, her husband works in construction as a sideline. It&apos;s a matter of &quot;diskarte&quot; (strategies) on how to earn a living. In the future, Rosila and Danny want to repair their house from their earnings.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>225</funded_amount><paid_amount>225</paid_amount><image><id>248147</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fishing</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

24 km from the city of Kasur, Pakistan. She completed her education up to 8th standard but couldn’t study further because of lack of financial resources from her parents. Her husband&apos;s name is D. E. and he has an animal-selling business. He buys animals from animal markets and sells specifically goats to butcher shops. He has 20 years&apos; experience in this business. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Maryam baji has two sons. Her elder son has a vegetable-selling business, and her younger son has a brick-selling business. Maryam baji keeps herself busy making embroidered dresses and doing knitting. She knits table covers and bed sheets and sells them in the market at a profit. She invests her income in a committee. She intends to marry off her elder son when she collects her committee amount. She is a regular member of Asasah (a micro-finance institute in Pakistan). She has successfully repaid five loans and now she is requesting her  6th loan to buy goats to expand her husband&apos;s animal-selling business.&lt;P&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Maryam baji is the group leader for some more women. Sakina baji and another lady called Sakina baji each want a loan to buy buffaloes for their milk-selling businesses. Rubina baji wants a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle). Rehana baji wants a loan to buy a donkey cart to carry loads. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another&apos;s loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1275</funded_amount><paid_amount>1275</paid_amount><image><id>248167</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Animal

So he decided to ask for a loan to buy more rice to re-sell. His wife, Mrs. Sem Limsaeang, helps him in the current business. Mr. Samreth K. has two children, one of whom is attending the local school, while the youngest one is only three years old and too young to work or study. His wife is shown on the right of the photo.

She and her husband, Mr. Hit Khin, are farmers who own a small piece of land to cultivate rice to earn a living. Although they try to work hard on their plantation, they still can earn little rice revenue to support the family. In order to improve their living conditions, Mrs. Srorn C. decided to ask for a loan to buy 125 ducks to start duck breeding business. She hopes to increase her income after she sells her ducks. Mrs. Srorn C. has six children -- one of whom is employed in a garment factory, while the others are attending the local school and the youngest one is only one year old and too young to work or study. Her husband is shown on the left of the photo.

She and her husband have three children two of whom are attending the local school while the youngest one is too young to work or study because that child is on the age of a year. She is a farmer who owns a small piece of land where she cultivates rice. Her husband, Mr. Vann Sophat, is a palm juice collector who gathers juice to process into palm sugar or wine. In this business, he now faces a problem because he does not have enough bamboo to tie to the palm tree to climb up to gather juice. In order to deal with this problem, Mrs. Sophat N. decided to ask for a loan of $500 to buy more bamboo for her husband&apos;s business. Her husband appears on the left of

She grows morning glory vegetable and sells in the market, and has been growing since 1995. She is married to Mr. Chuch Ie with five children, four of whom are married and one daughter is single, working in a garment factory. With much experience growing morning glory, her business is going well so far and can support her family sufficiently. Because of insufficient farmland to grow the crop for sale, O. needs to rent the farmland from her neighbors by paying rent annually. Hence, she now would like to request a loan to pay for renting farmland, purchase seeds, and to build a gate to protect her crops.

This is 43 year old Matilda A. N.. She is a married mother of three children who are between the ages of 6 and 18. She also supports two dependents who attend school near her house. Matilda is a Tanzanian entrepreneur who has been running a poultry business since 2007. In Tanzania it is called a “Kuku” business, as kuku means chicken in Swahili. Kuku is a favorite among Tanzanians and they make finger-licking good fried chicken here!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her business is simple, however tedious. She buys chicks, tends to them for five weeks, and then sells them in the market. But as you can see from her photo, tending to chickens is back breaking work!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her business is doing well and she is able to make an average monthly profit of about US$100. Matilda is requesting a loan in order to buy additional chicks and feed. She thanks you for your support!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ABOUT SELFINA:&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>475</funded_amount><paid_amount>475</paid_amount><image><id>248275</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Animal

This is 47 year old Hasadia J S.. She is married woman with five children between the ages of 14 and 26. She has owned a vitenge and tailoring business since 2007.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Women use these colorful and boldly printed fabrics to make traditional Tanzania outfits which usually consist of long fitted skirts and conservative boat necked tops.  As such, Hasadia is a smart entrepreneur and does not simply sell vitenge, but also offers her services as a seamstress.  Thus, customers can select the cloth and the style of outfit they would like as well as have their measurements taken. It’s really a one stop shop for women!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Currently her business is able to generate a monthly profit of about USD200 and she is requestring a loan in order to  purchase additional vitenge. In future she hopes to further increase the quantity and range of the stock. She thanks you for your support in advance!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ABOUT SELFINA:&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>625</funded_amount><paid_amount>625</paid_amount><image><id>248284</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Damiana hopes to continue working so that she can support her children and see them take up professional careers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>248289</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Catering</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Buy supplies for food business.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Puno, Puno</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-15.833333 -70.033333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>72</partner_id><posted_date>2009-01-01T08:01:07Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Damiana</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-12-12T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>3000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-12T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>750</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-12T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>750</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-12T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>750</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-12T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>750</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>250</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>250</amount><local_amount>750</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-12T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T13:43:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>768.62</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10225120</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>250</amount><local_amount>750</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-12T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T19:46:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>768.62</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20417873</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>250</amount><local_amount>750</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-12T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T20:12:47Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>768.62</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27111325</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>250</amount><local_amount>750</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-12T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T21:15:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>768.62</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36006513</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2009-01-04T19:42:46Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-05-15T21:15:40Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>81715</id><name>Aurelia</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Aurelia es casada, su esposo es mecánico de maquinaria pesada en una compañía que fabrica plataformas marinas.

This is 32 year old Navoneiwa R J.. She is married with three children between the ages of 5 and 19 and she is proud to report that all of them are in school.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In April 2008, she started a shoe selling business and has been running it since with the assistance of her husband. Her business has been doing well and her monthly profits are about USD100. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional shoes, sandals and slippers. Due to the success of this business, she hopes to be able to open another business in the future. She thanks you in advance for your support! &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ABOUT SELFINA:&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

This is 31 year old Upendo J K.. She is a married mother of two children who are 6 and 8 years old. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She runs a grocery store and is assisted by her husband. She works at her business 10 hours a day and 6 days per week. Her business is doing well and her monthly profits are approximately US$250. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional stocks of rice, wheat flour, sugar, maize flour, and some animal feed. Due to the success of her business, she hopes to open another business in the future. She thanks you in advance for your support.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ABOUT SELFINA:&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1150</funded_amount><paid_amount>1150</paid_amount><image><id>248300</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

This is 33 year old Nsia I. M.. She is married with three children between the ages of 2 and 8. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nsia is quite the entrepreneur as she runs two businesses: a kuku (poultry) business and a tailoring business.  Seems a bit unrelated to the average person, but it makes sense here in Tanzania. A kuku business is a simple, profitable, and popular business here in Tanzania. You simply buy chicks, tend to them for 5 weeks, and then sell them in the market. It does not take all day to tend to the chickens, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, so a go-getter like Nsia also has time to run another business. Her tailoring business is a bit more complicated as she needs to properly measure and sew outfits to her customers&apos; specifications, and customers can be quite demanding!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her businesses are doing well and her monthly profits are approximately US$600. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional chicks and feed for her kuku business, as well as materials for making clothes for her tailoring business. She thanks you in advance for your support!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ABOUT SELFINA:&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>775</funded_amount><paid_amount>775</paid_amount><image><id>248313</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Tailoring</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To

He opened his business in June 2000 after him and his partner, a woman that used to work with him at a factory, were fired. After that, they decided to become partners and get into the business of making doughnuts and “empanadas”. At the beginning they had to knock on many doors to be able to sell their products, but once customers started to know them they have expanded their business and they are now devoted to prepare and deliver the many requests they receive every day. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He needs a loan of $450 that will be canceled in 6 months to purchase raw material that will allow them to lower the cost of their

They will use the money as working capital to buy wholesale merchandise at the Masaya municipal market. They will then sell the merchandise at retail prices from their homes, which allows them to work while taking care of their children and homes. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Maylorc sells Movistar and Claro brand prepaid cellular phone cards. His parents gave him a small amount of capital to start his business.

Together with his brother, they started the business at a lot where originally only the car wash was built. Now it is a square where his relatives are owners and they conditioned the lot according to the existing businessess inside the square.  He started the business in May of 1994.  At his brother&apos;s initiative, they established a car wash where they are partners and due to their lack of education it was impossible for them to get better compensated jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since they started, it has been going very good since besides that they are located at a commercial square, the same clients have been recommended them thanks to the excellent work that they do.

For that reason, she also decided to diversify her business and start selling fruit that she buys in the district of Tinco to later on sell them together with her herb in the city of Huaraz.&#13;&#10;

Hoy en día de nuevo ha comenzado a levantar su tiendita y ya la tiene más surtida.&#10;&#10;Ella necesita un préstamo por MXN $5,000 que pagara en 10 catorcenas  para comprar más verduras y abarrotes que le permitan tener bien surtida su tienda para este mes de diciembre en que las ventas aumentan por motivo de las fiestas navideñas.&#10;</es><en>&lt;p&gt;Francisca started her business because she has always liked commerce. Also, because in the area that she lives there was no one that sells any produce and that motivated her to start selling it and slowly, she has been adding more products. She started selling produce on August 1992 as soon as she arrived at her current address. Lately, she opened a small shop but due to health reasons, she had to close it and only stayed with the produce business.  Today, she has started again to build up her small shop and provide it with more assorted products.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; She needs a $375 loan to buy more produce and groceries that will allow her to keep the shop with a good assortment of products during the month of December when the sales increase due to the holiday festivities. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br

She started her business in April of 2003 because she needed sufficient income to support herself and one of her daughters, who was very sick and whose husband abandoned and stopped supporting them over five years ago.  Sadly, her daughter died a short while after she started her business.  She started selling beauty products after being encouraged to sell them by a neighbor who said that there was always a good demand for beauty products.  Little by little she made progress as she increased her customer base as well as her income, which is still progressing to this day.  In addition to selling cosmetics, she sells Christmas themed handicrafts during the Christmas season, which help to increase her earnings.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Marcela needs a loan for $10,000 MXN, which she will repay in 12 payments.  The loan will be used to purchase cosmetics and raw materials to create her Christmas handicrafts so that she can fill the orders from her customers.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br

Comenzó  en 1982 vendiendo productos cosméticos entre sus compañeros de trabajo y vecinos, en las noches también vendía cenas para completar para los gastos de la casa pues hijos estaban muy pequeños.

She wanted to give her children the best life she could and although she was employed by a motel, she felt that she did not earn enough to provide her children with everything she wanted for them.  In 1982 she began selling cosmetic products to her coworkers and neighbors.  She also sold dinners at night in order to help pay for the household expenses since her children were very young.  Later, she began selling products of a different brand and now spends the majority of her time selling these products.  In addition, she sells lottery tickets and new clothes.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Imelda needs a loan for $8,000 MXN, which she will repay in 12 payments.  The loan will be used to buy cosmetics so that she will have an extensive assortment of products to sell during the end of the year season, when her customers have a higher demand for her merchandise.

Primero empezó a ayudarla a ella en su negocio de Agua Purificada, y ya después que se junto con su actual pareja y se cambio de domicilio a otra colonia, vio que en esa zona casi no había expendios de agua, por lo que se asocio con su tía para distribuir el agua que ella fabrica en la zona donde vive, por lo que actualmente surte en las tiendas de la zona y a particulares. En la actualidad, aparte del negocio de agua también se dedico a promover vales de zapatos de una prestigiada zapatería de la ciudad de los cuales obtiene una comisión como ganancia y también trabaja en la cooperativa de una escuela secundaria vendiendo comida para los alumnos y maestros.&#10;&#10;Ella necesita un préstamo por MXN $5,000 que pagara en 10 catorcenas  para comprar mas botellones ya que cada día esta ampliando mas su zona de reparto y también para comprar materia prima para la elaboración de las comidas.&#10;</es><en>Luz Maria started her business in August of 1995 when she arrived at her aunt&apos;s house in the city of Tampico, Tamaulipas with her recently born son.  Her aunt supported Luz Maria upon seeing her situation.  First, Luz Maria began to help her aunt in her purified water business.  After she joined with her current parter and moved her home to another district, she saw that in this zone there were almost no water suppliers.  For this reason, she formed a partnership with her aunt to distribute the water that she makes in the region where she lives, which Luz Maria now supplies to the stores in the district and to private homes.  Currently, aside from the water business, she also promotes shoes for a prestigious shoe store in the city.  She receives a commission as her earnings.  She also works in the store of a high school, selling food for the students and teachers.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Luz Maria needs a loan of $5,000 Mexican pesos, which she will repay in 10 bi-monthly installments, to buy more large bottles, since her delivery zone is expanding each day.  She also needs the loan to buy staples for preparing the foods.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Anne Rodriguez, Kiva

She is a teacher and considers her profession the greatest achievement of her personal life. Liliana alternates her work as a teacher with work growing and selling pigs. She buys the animals at the Carhuaz fair or in the rural zone of the Tinco district and then sells them to order from her home, or delivers the meat directly to her clients. Liliana asserts that her business has grown steadily. When she started the business she did so with an investment of 300 Peruvian soles and currently she invests more than 1000 soles into every animal purchase. However, she add that one of the pigs she bought in her last purchase was infested with trichina (a parasite that lives in pork meat and is a threat to human health); trichina is a common problem in Liliana&apos;s line of business. For that reason she will now also market guinea pigs in order to diversify her products and continue growing her business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan of 2,500 soles, which she will repay in 8 installements, Lillian will invest in the purchase of guinea pigs and swine.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Liliana takes as a given the need to learn about new lines of business in order to continue

He started the business in March 2001 because his father and brother, both of whom are bricklayers, taught him the trade since he earned very little as an employee. In this way, he was able to earn a better income. &#13;&#10;His business has been growing little by little but nowadays he can pursue larger construction projects. He began doing small projects such as plastering, straw work, fixing floors, etc. Now he can build a house.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At this time, he needs a loan of MXN $3,000, which he will repay in 8 periods of fourteen days. The loan will be used to buy some tools so that he can pursue more work and buy material like plaster, cement, and glue for tiles. He will take advantage of this time at the end of the year, when people try to repair their homes. &#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva

This made it so, on certain dates, the family was short of the income needed for basic household expenses.  For this reason, they decided to set up a stationery store since her husband knows this business, as he was a commissioner for a large stationery store.  She began the business in August of 1993 in what was the living room of their house.  She  prepared a small space to put a few shelves and a small counter with basic stationery items, which she brought with her to make the products known through the relatively new district.  Since it began, the business has gone very well given that her clients have recommended her which has allowed her to generate more clients.  Currently, in addition to selling stationery items, they sell gifts and novelties according to the needs of her clients.  And, since there is a school nearby, they are able to offer a new service, photocopying documents, which has considerably increased their income.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Now she needs a loan of $11,000 Mexican pesos, which she will repay in 6 months, to buy another photocopier so that she can provide better and faster services to her clients.&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated

Every day Virginia extracts fine sand and thick mud to sell to buyers that transport the supplies to construction sites.

Her husband is recently unemployed.  Her greatest wish is to make improvements to her home so that her children can live more comfortably.  She plans to build a future for her family by increasing her business and continue working so that the business can continue to generate income which will allow her to provide her children with stability for their studies, that they may have a bright future.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She buys and sells pigs.  Her business is home-based in Chichigalpa.  She started her business on her own as she had to make a better life for her family.  Initially, she sold nacatamales (typical food) and did not have many clients and due to high costs the business did not generate enough income.  She had to sell her food for a much lower price than it cost her to make it.  It became more feasible to sell her product abroad: she has friends who travel abroad and who placed orders for pork with her, and therefore she has decided to focus on this business.  The loan she requests is working capital because she needs to invest in the purchase of more pigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva

She has not had any difficulties which she has been unable to overcome, and looking after her children and her business has been her greatest achievement. She extracts and sells construction materials (sand, stones), which she excavates from an area of the Santa River in the Tacllan zone on the outskirts of the city of Huaraz. Later she distributes the materials to construction companies using her own means of transportation (dump truck). She shares the business with her husband and it has gone well. Now however there is much more competition because of the use of larger-volume extraction machinery and many of the smaller businesses either sell to the larger ones or get out of the business. Eva would like to have another business which generates greater income.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this loan for S/. 1,700, which will be repaid in six installments, she will repair and maintain the dump truck.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Eva would like to learn about other business alternatives.&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>575</funded_amount><paid_amount>575</paid_amount><image><id>248485</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Construction Supplies</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>Repair and maintenance of machinery.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Huaraz -

With this business, she was able to make enough money to support her family and as her business became well known in her neighbourhood because of the delicious baked goods she made herself.  In addition to baking, she realized she could also prepare foods such as quesadillas.  Due to her age, she finds herself unable to continue making quesadillas and so has decided to sell only baked goods.  The loan is for working capital which she will use to buy raw materials in bulk to maximize her profits, products such as: flour, sugar, eggs and cheese among others.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva

Together with her brother, she decided to set up a small grocery store to pay for their family’s basic needs.  They began the store in January of 2003, in the same location it is in today, originally selling only soda, snacks, and a few grocery items.  They now sell mostly groceries and wish to add a delicatessen and dairy products to the store.  Since opening, the grocery store has attracted more and more customers thanks to good customer service.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Susana needs a loan of 4,500 MXN, which she will pay back in 6 months, to buy merchandise that will meet all of her customers’ needs.

Eight years ago, after much effort, she opened up her own general store because she had to be both the mother and father of the household, facing the difficulties of life on her own. However, thanks to her great business abilities, she was able to take advantage of the opportunities that came her way. Thus, she obtained the general store she had always wanted. She is fully dedicated to her shop; she never neglects it and keeps it open to meet her neighbors’ demands. Customer service is her priority, and she manages to make hers a lucrative business despite the high prices. This is Agustina’s third loan with MFP, and she has always been a very responsible and enthusiastic client in her group since she motivates the other members to face adversity. With the money that she is requesting, she will obtain more goods for her store, thus making it one of the most competitive shops in her locality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from

At the age of 42, Clemencia S. admits that there is no room for her to rest comfortably and wait for unknown blessings. She and her husband Ernesto did not finish any college degree.  Given that fact, the couple tried the fishing business.  The first few months went by with unpredictable returns. But the couple did not give up.  They continued and learned the business. At present, they own 2 units of pumpboats that give a weekly net income of PHP 800 to PHP 1,000.  Not bad when they were just starting out. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; To yield more income, they want to purchase additional fish nets which they can have for rent.  They applied for a loan in the amount of PHP 10,000 from Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative.  Clemencia has safeguarded her credit records with the cooperative.  Being a member for almost 4 years, she shared that though the loan windows are readily available, the savings products of Paglaum are what she likes most.  &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. and Mrs. S. have saved for the education of their children. They want their children to be able to fulfill their dreams by pursuing their studies.  They conclude that Paglaum MPC has been a consistent partner in extending financial assistance for their livelihood.  So if financial difficulties arise, they can always run to Paglaum.

Sarun Um Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>This is a village bank loan to a group that consists of ten people in PhU. Ty village in Kampong Chhnang province. Mr. Sarun U. is the village bank president. He is a vice village chief who makes a little salary. His wife, Mrs. Khun Chanda, is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate rice to earn a living. Aside from the plantation, she is a rice middleman who buys rice to keep in stock and then resell later at a better price. Since this business is going well, she wants to expand it, so Mr. Sarun U. decided to ask for a loan to buy more rice to keep in stock. Mr. Sarun U. is 46 years old and the father of three children who all attend the local school. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Two members in this village bank loan have end-of-term loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans. The end-of-term members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK’s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor. These allow people to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and a default rate of 0% on Kiva.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1375</funded_amount><paid_amount>1375</paid_amount><image><id>248669</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

The young couple were blessed with three children and live in Danao, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental. Cristine became a member of Paglaum Multi Purpose Cooperative way back in April 2003. With the wide array of programs and services of the Cooperative, she decided to join Paglaum MPC. Two of their children are beneficiaries of Paglaum Community Development Foundation Incorporated (PCDFI), the mother organization, and at the same time, the social development partner of the Cooperative. With the education sponsorship of PCDFI to their children, the couple is aiming to survive on their daily expenses. Gifted with skills in carpentry, they tried their hand at the construction of fishing boats. In need of capital, they are reaching out to Paglaum Multi Purpose Cooperative for a PHP 15,000 loan. Cristine and Eddie would like to own a motorized pumpboat in the future and hope to see their children fulfill their lifelong careers.

Thy Klang Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>The group receiving this village bank loan consists of twenty people I. Thnal village I. Kampong Chhnang province. Mrs. Thy K. is a village bank president. She is a rice middleman who buys rice to keep I. stock and then resell later at a better price. Since this business is going well, she wants to expand it, so she decided to ask for a loan to buy more rice to keep I. stock. She hopes to increase her income and improve her living conditions with this new loan. Her husband, Mr. Uk Kry, is a construction worker who can make a little income to support the family. Mrs. Thy K. is 48 years old and the mother of four children who all attend the local school.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Eight members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK’s maI. product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor. These allow people to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and a default rate of 0% on Kiva.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2400</funded_amount><paid_amount>2400</paid_amount><image><id>248676</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

Her husband, Mr. Y Im, is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;All the members in this group loan have end-of-term loans, so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK’s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor. These allow people to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and a default rate of 0% on Kiva.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>248696</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Poultry</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To buy more ducks for breeding</use><location><country_code>KH</country_code><country>Cambodia</country><geo><level>country</level><pairs>13 105</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>109</partner_id><posted_date>2009-01-01T08:01:11Z</posted_date><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Chheng Oin</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Ngim</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Ly</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Thin</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-12-05T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>KHR</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1150000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2009-12-07T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1150000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2010-02-01T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>300</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>78.26</amount><local_amount>300000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-10-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-11-15T12:59:15Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>314620.43</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>96899810</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>221.74</amount><local_amount>850000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-12-31T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2010-01-15T11:37:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>891424.57</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>110625382</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2009-01-03T12:55:23Z</funded_date><paid_date>2010-01-15T11:37:45Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>81868</id><name>Chhunmeng</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mr. Chhunmeng M. was born in 1961, and he now lives in Choeung Wat village in Kampong Cham province.

On the farm, they face some problems with insufficient rice seeds and infertile soil. In order to solve these problems, Mrs. Leng K. decided to ask for a loan to buy seeds and fertilizer. In addition, she would use the rest of the loan to buy a pump to water the field to make her crop more productive. She is 43 years old and the mother of four children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory while the others attend the local school.

Ten years ago, Jura saw a need for students to be able to buy used books and office supplies, so he opened a store which he operates with his loving family for this purpose. Jura has plentiful orders for a variety of books and office supplies, and now is applying to IMON for a loan to fulfill his orders. The well-being of Jura’s family and his business are in your hands, and they are sincerely grateful for your support.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;More about Tajikistan and IMON International&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great&apos;s rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as  Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve the country’s agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;IMON&apos;s History&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients present a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International&apos;s clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This business allows him to support his large family which consists of his wife, parents, two sisters and little brother. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Today Sadriddinkhoja needs to increase the range of the goods he sells and so is requesting a loan of $1200 for the term of 12 months.

Be an important part of the growth of Sadriddinkhoja’s business!  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;More about Tajikistan and IMON International&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great&apos;s rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;IMON&apos;s History&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International&apos;s clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and the loving mother of two children. Malohat breeds calves and cows. She buys the calves at the market for a low price, then feeds them and resells them at the same market for a more profitable amount. Her husband, who is in the picture too, also helps with this business. Malohat works hard in order to make the business successful and generate a stable income for the family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Now, Malohat is planning to purchase three calves to raise and then sell.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;IMON&apos;s History:&#13;&#10;Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International&apos;s clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kampong Chhnang province. Mrs. Samnang C. is a farmer who cultivates both rice and vegetable. In vegetable farming, she faces a small problem because she does not have enough money to buy bean seeds to cultivate in the field. In order to deal with this problem, Mrs. Samnang C. decided to ask for a loan to buy more bean seeds. Her husband, Mr. Real Sophal, helps her in the farming. Mrs. Samnang C. is 44 years old and the mother of five children one of whom is working in a garment factory while the others are attending the local school. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;All the members in this village bank loan have end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. The end-of-term (EoT) loan is AMK&apos;s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia&apos;s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term.

Mrs. Nem S. is a 32-year-old widow with three children two of whom are attending the local school while the remaining one is too young to work or study.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;All the members in this village bank loan are end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. The end-of-term (EoT) loan is AMK&apos;s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia&apos;s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK&apos;s clients make their payments on time.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>248765</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fishing</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To buy more fishnets and fishing line for her business. </use><location><country_code>KH</country_code><country>Cambodia</country><geo><level>country</level><pairs>13 105</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>109</partner_id><posted_date>2009-01-01T08:01:12Z</posted_date><loan_amount>400</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Nem</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Kuch</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Sinat</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Keng</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Nun</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Chheng Hai</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-12-08T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>KHR</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1600000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>400</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2009-08-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1600000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-10-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-30T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T11:02:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>104042.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35941721</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-05-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-06-15T21:06:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>208085</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44400024</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>325</amount><local_amount>1300000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-08-05T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-09-15T11:06:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1352552.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>73552500</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2009-01-03T19:40:03Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-09-15T11:06:09Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>81893</id><name>Waliholla</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Waliholla is 39 years old and married with 3 children.

Her husband, Robert Chamorro, is 40 years old. They have three children. Their son is eight years old and their daughters are six and four, respectively. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lorena and her husband own a grocery and butcher shop. He works with the supplies, and she works with the clients. Robert buys the animals himself, later he butchers and sells the meat in the same business. This process increases the business&apos; income, because he acts as the conduit to sell other products such as noodles, rice, cooking oil, salt, tapioca, and other staples. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lorena and Robert have developed a base of clients over the past five years, since they opened the store. They began this work by selling milk, and little by little they earned the capital to start their own business, which is now a well-supplied butcher shop and store. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The loan will go toward the purchase of cider, beer, and soda, as we&apos;re now getting closer to end-of-the year parties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo (Greetings!) from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and from SELFINA!!  This is 35-year-old Selina A D., who is divorced with two children aged 8 and 14. Selina has been running  a beauty salon business since 2003, a place where her friends and fellow women can gather and literally let their hair down.  Most beauty salons in Tanzania are places where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own.  It is quite a thing to be seen!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Selina works at her business ten hours a day, seven days a week, earning a monthly profit of approximately $200.  She is now requesting a loan of $775 in order to purchase an additional hair dryer, chairs, hair products such as wigs, and other cosmetics.  Due to the success of this business, she hopes to open another in the future, and she thanks you in advance for your support.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ABOUT SELFINA:&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>775</funded_amount><paid_amount>775</paid_amount><image><id>248902</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Beauty

This is 43-year-old Mariam A. M., married with four children between the ages of 20 and 26. Mariam has been running a bar since 2004. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her bar is a good place to relax and catch up with friends.  Many cannot think of a better way to end a hard day’s work than with an ice cold local beer, under the shade from the blaring Tanzanian sun, with one’s friends. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Working at the business 16 hours per day, 7 days per week, and assisted by three employees, Mariam currently earns about $250 each month. She is now requesting a loan of $1000 in order to purchase additional stocks of beer, soda and drinking water, and in the future plans to increase her variety of stocks. Mariam thanks you for your support!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ABOUT SELFINA:&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

This is 35-year-old Johari J. M. from Dar es Salaam, the married mother of a nine-year-old child. Johari has been running a tailoring business since 2003. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At her tailoring business she purchases vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides) and makes them into clothing mainly for women.  She confided in us that what sets her tailoring business apart is that she is more skilled than others and is able to create different kinds of designs for her customers so they can stand out in a crowd. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Working at the business 11 hours per day, 6 days per week, and assisted by her husband, Johari currently earns about $240 per month. She is now requesting a loan of $550 to purchase additional materials required for making clothes. In the future, she plans to carry a greater variety of materials in order to differentiate her products even further.  Johari thanks you for your support!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ABOUT SELFINA:&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>248916</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Tailoring</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To

This is 48-year-old Tatu O M., a widowed mother of six children who is also responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans. Tatu has been running a mama lishe since 2005. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;A mama lishe is a local restaurant or café in Tanzania that usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long wooden benches. The food is all-local:  rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Working at the business eight hours per day, five days per week, Tatu currently earns about $200 each month.  She is now requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase rice, beans, wheat flower, maize flower, soda and drinking water, and in the future plans to expand her business.  She thanks you in advance for your support!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ABOUT SELFINA:&#13;&#10;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>248923</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cafe</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

hace más de 25 años y es muy conocida su despensa en el barrio, ya que gracias a los préstamos que le otorgó la Fundación Paraguaya pudo surtir  bien su negocio. &#10;Tiene pensado para este verano ampliar su despensa ya que nó está pudiendo exhibir todas las mercaderías que tiene en stock, por el espacio muy reducido con  que cuenta actualmente dentro de la despensa.  &#10;Don José, dice que es un luchador por lo sacrificado que es éste rubro porque uno trabaja de Lunes a Lunes y no se tiene fin de semana, a parte la atención se inicia desde las 05:00 hs. de la mañana, pero se siente muy contento porque maneja su propio negocio y con esto mantiene los gastos de su familia y también le  permite dar una buena  educación  a sus hijos.&#10;Sus principales clientes son las personas que trabajan en oficinas de  la zona, como así también los chiperos y obreros de la fábrica de cerámicas del barrio a quiénes también les provee de los servicio de comidas y desayunos.&#10;</es><en>José

He owns a grocery store, which he runs from his home.  He opened the business 25 years ago and his store is very well known in the neighbourhood, as he has been able to keep his store well stocked thanks to loans from Fundación Paraguaya.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He plans to expand his store this summer as he is not able to display all the merchandise he has in stock, given the limited space in the store as it is now.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;José tells us he is a fighter who has sacrificed much working 7 days a week and never having a weekend off.  He opens at 5 A.M. but he has very happy to be working for himself and thanks to his business he is able to pay the household expenses as well as give his children a good education.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;His customers are mostly people who work in local offices, as well as chiperos (street vendors who sell a typical cheese bun) and factory workers from the local ceramics factory to whom he provides meals and breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva

Sa Mai Sor Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>The village bank group, which consists of seventeen people is located in Phum Thmey village in Kampong Chhnang province. Mrs. Sa Mai S. is the group president who has been selected by the members. She is a housewife who cooks delicious foods for her family. Her husband, Mr. Deam Von, is a construction worker who makes a small income that supports the family. They have six children, four of whom are working in a garment factory, while the others attend the local school. Although Mrs. Sa Mai S.’s family members work hard, they still live in an old house that is in poor condition. In order to improve these conditions, Mrs. Sa Mai S. decided to ask for a loan which along with her savings, will allow her to build a new house for the family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Village bank group loans consist mainly of end-of-term loans. Five members have had end-of-term loans and the rest have had monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK’s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2275</funded_amount><paid_amount>2275</paid_amount><image><id>249075</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Construction</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>To

Dalin Pich Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Eighteen people who live in Phum Thmey village in Kampong Chhnang province have formed a village bank group and are requesting a loan for a variety of purposes. Mrs. Dalin P. is the village bank group president. She is a farmer who earns a small rice farming revenue which cannot support the famiL. very well. Her husband, Mr. Hem Sambo, is an immigrant worker in Korea, working in a garment factory. Mrs. Dalin P. is 32 years old and the mother of five children, four are attending the local school while the youngest one is two years old. Although Mrs. Dalin P.&apos;s famiL. members work hard, they still do not have enough money to build a fence for her house. Mrs. Dalin P. decided to ask for a loan to buy wood to build the fence for her house.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a village bank group loan consisting of mainL. end-of-term loans. Thirteen members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthL. payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK’s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financialL. able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of onL. 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% at Kiva.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1775</funded_amount><paid_amount>1775</paid_amount><image><id>249079</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

Specifically, he provides services to his customers by making windows, doors, and other such structures for houses. He notes that he started his business more than eight years ago, and that he has gained a great deal of experience over that time span. To make it easier on his family members for transportation purposes, Pich is now applying for a loan in order to purchase a motorcycle (so that his family members can get where they need to go

Both say that their incomes are totally independent of one another.  The members operate various business such as cleaning services; messaging services; ceramic works; public transportation services; and milk, food and cosmetics sales.  All of their businesses face stiff competition but the members are experienced and know how to manage their businesses and work with equanimity.  Generally, the loan will be used to buy basic supplies, make the businesses more productive and allow the members to spend the time they save with their families.  The members have experience with cooperatives so they know how to responsibly manage the funds allocated to them.  Their common objective is to improve their lives and the lives of their families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

The members operate businesses such as metalurgical product sales; food sales; and cosmetics sales.  Some of the members who now work tending vineyards or as domestics, want to strike out on their own and start new businesses, all with the hope of looking for new opportunities to improve their lives and the lives of their families.

As in all commercial endeavors, there&apos;s competition and offers to sell similar products at lower costs, so the members have to have products for which there&apos;s a lot of demand and sell them for less.  One advantage for the group is that their businesses are located outsiD. of the city which gives them greater opportunities to sell.  The disadvantage of that for them is that their children can only get a rural education.  They hope to send their children to the city where they would receive a better education.  The loan will be used to buy merchandise and supplies to meet the demands of the market.  The members will be completing their third cycle so they know how to work within a cooperative and have demonstrated the responsibility and honesty required to get financing like that provided by Fundacion Agrocapital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mrs. Chamroeurn Y. is the leader of a group of five people, all of whom live in the village of Kraing Sromor in Kampong Chhnang province. Her husband, Mr. Brok P., helps her on the plantation. She is 45 years old, and she is the mother of five children; three of her children are employed in a garment factory, while the other two children are currently attending the local school. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Chamroeurn Y. is a pig breeder who is currently raising one pig. Because her business has been doing rather well, she wants to expand and improve the business. Accordingly, she decided to ask for a loan in order to buy two more piglets for her breeding business. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This group loan primarily consists of what are referred to as &quot;end-of-term&quot; (&quot;EoT&quot;) loans. Indeed, three members are seeking such EoT loans, while the other group members are seeking monthly payment loans. More specifically, with the EoT loans, the borrowers are not required to repay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan&apos;s term (i.e., the maturity date), whereas the monthly payment loans require the borrowers to make regular monthly payments. EoT loans are AMK’s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor people; in particular, such loans allow the borrowers to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Interestingly, most clients start to make principal payments on EoT loans many months before the end of the loan&apos;s term. Further, almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time: AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva loans. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;One group member, Mrs. Sovann Y., is not seeking a loan, but her husband is applying for a loan; as a result, he is captured in the picture rather than her.

Yet Tol Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>This village bank group consists of fifteen people who live in the village of Spean Pau in Kampong Chhnang province. The group is collectively seeking a loan, but all of the members will use the loan proceeds for different purposes, depending on their individual business needs. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Yet T. is the village bank president. She owns a small restaurant where she sells Khmer noodles to both residents of and visitors to her local village. Her husband, Mr. Prak Noeurn, is a carpenter who makes beds, chairs, and other such wood products. Mrs. Yet T. is 39 years old, and she is the mother of two children, both of whom help their parents with their current businesses. Although she and her husband (and their children, for that matter) work extremely hard, they still do not earn sufficient income to properly support the family. As a matter of fact, they do not have enough money to purchase rice to keep in stock to feed the family. Thus, Mrs. Yet T. decided to ask for a loan in order to purchase rice. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;One group member, Mr. Chandara H., is not seeking a loan, but his wife is; so, his wife is captured in the picture rather than him.

formed a village bank loan group. Mr. C. B. is the village bank loan group president who has been selected by the members. He is a farmer who owns a small plot of land and cultivates rice to earn for living. His wife, Mrs. Khum Lay, works in a garment factory and contributes a small salary to the support of the family. Although they work hard, they still cannot support the family well. In order to improve their living conditions, Mr. C. B. decided to ask for a loan to buy a cow to start a breeding business. Mr. C. B. is 29 years old and the father of two children who attend the local school. Mr. C. B.&apos;s wife is shown in the picture.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Two members in this village bank loan are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK’s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>249137</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Sine Keo Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>This village bank loan group consists of nine people, located in Andoung Chros village in Kampong Chhnang province. Each of the members in this group will use this loan for different purposes. Mrs. Sine K. is the village bank loan group president. She owns a small restaurant where she sells rice soup to villagers and passerbys in the local village. Her husband, Mr. Leang Pinh, is a rice wine maker in the local village. Aside from this business, he is a breeder and raises fourteen pigs. Since this business is going well, he wants to expand it, so Mrs. Sine K. decided to ask for a loan to buy three more piglets for breeding. Mrs. Sine K. is 27 years old and the mother of five children. Three  are attending the local school while the others stay at home as they are too young to work or study. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Two members in this village bank group loan are end-of-term loans and the rest are monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK’s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1175</funded_amount><paid_amount>1175</paid_amount><image><id>249138</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Now she is applying for a loan to buy another buffalo to expand her husband’s business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is joined in her loan group by some more women. Barkat baji wants a loan to buy a buffalo for a milk selling business. Sharifan baji wants a loan to buy groceries for her grocery shop. Shazia baji wants a loan to buy artificial jewelry to resell. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another&apos;s loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>249147</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Dairy</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

She owns a two room brick house, where she has lived with her family for the past 30 years. Her husband&apos;s name is M. R., and he runs a grocery shop in the community. He has 20 years of experience in this business. Hanifan baji has five kids: three sons and two daughters. Her elder son works with his father. The next to him is a welder. The other kids attend school near their house. Hanifan baji spends her time knitting clothes for her neighbors. She is saving her income and plans to renovate the house. She successfully repaid her first loan from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now she is applying again for a loan to buy groceries to diversify her husband’s grocery shop into a store. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is a group leader of some more women. Sharifan baji wants a loan to buy groceries for her grocery shop. Nasreen baji wants a loan to buy products (cooking oil, lentils and spices) for her food selling business. Shamim baji wants a loan to buy wood to resell. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another&apos;s loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>249163</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

Chantha Tuy Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Twenty-one people from the village of Kandal Kraom in Kandal Province formed a group to apply for a village bank loan. They will use the loan for different purposes. Mrs. Chantha T. is the village bank president. She is a farmer who owns a small piece of land where she cultivates rice. However, she does not have enough rice seeds to grow on her land. So she decided to request a loan for this purpose, and will use the rest of the loan to purchase fertilizer to make her crop more productive. Her husband, Mr. PH. Phally, sells icecream in the local village. Mrs. Chantha T. is 42 years old and the mother of four childR., one of whom helps with the father&apos;s business while another is employed in a garment factory and the others attend the local school.

He is married and lives with his family, in Ningarhar province .  Shapoor has 2 children, who go to school.  His brother works with him on the agricultural lands that they own. They share a single house. After his father died, Shapoor became the responsible person for the household.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Besides farming, Shapoor is a teacher .  He teaches in a public school in the morning, and in the afternoon he works as a farmer in his village. He grows different kinds of vegetables and sells them in the bazaar.  Along with the farming, he has livestock.  His small son brings grass for the animals.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Shapoor is a hardworking man, but there are 14 members in his family and supporting that many people with only 500 Afghanis ($10) a day income is almost impossible.  He therefore has to expand his business.  He thinks that if he buys more livestock and seed for his land, he can increase his income. He has requested AFSG for a 50000(AF) ($1,075) loan.  He has decided to buy a cow and with the remaining loan, purchase seed and pesticide. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Shapoor K. dreams of the day that he solves all his economic problems and can concentrate on

this village bank and they will use the loan which they obtained for different purposes. Mr. DE. M. is the village bank president. He is a village chief who makes only a small salaR. to support his family. His wife, Mrs. Say Soth, is a farmer who owns 0.2-hectare where she cultivates rice. Although they cultivate rice, they still make only a little rice revenue which cannot support the family. In order to support them, Mr. DE. M. decided to ask for a loan to buy rice to eat. He is a 59-year-old and the father of two childrE., one of whom is employed in a garment factoR. while the other is staying at home to do housework.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Two members in this village bank loan have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Those who have EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the veR. end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK’s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

He sells ice-cream. In this business, he faces an obstacle because he does not have a motorbike to transport the ice cream to sell door-to-door. Thus, he decided to ask for a loan to add to his savings to buy a motorbike for his business. He hopes to increase his income and improve the living conditions of his family with this loan. His wife, Mrs. Mouk Meth, is a housewife. Mr. Meth L. is 55 years old and the father of ten children, two of whom are farmers while another is employed in a garment factory. One of his children is a laborer while the others are attending the local school. Mr. Meth L. is not in the picture because he was busy with his work so his wife is shown instead in the

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Nader K. is a 52 year old man.  He is married and the father of four children.  The household has lived in Ningarhar province for a long time.  Nander has worked as a farmer for the last several years in his village. His children go to school and he is the sole breadwinner for his family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nader grows different kinds of vegetables on his land and sells them in the central market of the city.  However, his current $8 a day income is not sufficient to support the family; he needs at least $20.  Besides their schooling, his sons help him on the farm  but Nader doesn’t allow them spend to much time working the farm, as he wants them to do well in school and pursue a bright future.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Nader K. has been thinking about how to solve his problems for a while now. He finally decided to purchase a water pump and increase his livestock.  He knows that this business is quite profitable in his area. There are a lot of grasslands in his village and he would be able to provide sufficient food for the stock. He believes that with the purchase of a water pump he could sell water to other farmers in his village.  With this plan in mind, he has applied for 50,000 Afghanis loan to be repaid over 27 months.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Nader K. wants to expand his business, buying more livestock and start a livestock selling business in future. He thanks the lenders for their assistance.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1050</funded_amount><paid_amount>1050</paid_amount><image><id>249188</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Pruchase

She has been separated for 13 years.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rosa studied until the 2nd grade and says that at the time it was difficult to go to school in her area because a girl would go to school as a 10 year old and at 17 she would be obligated to be at home.  In this way she was not able to study.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rosa, after her separation, had to begin a business to sustain her children.  The business consists of purchasing and selling staple products, an activity she continues today.  She has one employee, a monthly income of 9,800MT, and is able to save some money periodically.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is her third loan through Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  The others also were applied to the purchase of merchandise, and she intends to pay this loan off before the maturity so she can solicit another loan to make arrangements in her home.&lt;br

From a young age Fernando had to work to support himself. His first business was selling bread, and later he invested in a small commercial establishment and started selling basic goods. Today he has a larger, general store type of establishment. His monthly income is approximately 24,000.00 MT and he is able to save 2,000.00 MT. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is Fernando’s second loan through Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. His first was for 8,000.00 MT, which he used to buy supplies. He intends to do the same with this loan. In the future he would like to request another loan that would permit him to save more money so that he can later buy a vehicle to help in purchasing supplies. &#13;&#10;&lt;br

Boeurn Krouch Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>The village bank loan, which consists of sixteen people, is located in Chrey Bak village in Kampong Chhnang province, and all the members will use the loan for different purposes. Mrs. Boeurn K. is the village bank president. She and her husband, Mr. Nith Veasna, are farmers who own a plot of land for cultivating rice. It is now harvest season, and Mrs. Boeurn K. does not have enough money to hire laborers to harvest the rice.Thus, she decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. She is 56 years old and the mother of five children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory, two help their parents on the plantation, and the youngest one is attending the local school. Mr. Saret R. did not come to take a loan but his wife did, so she is presented in the picture instead of him.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Four members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK’s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia’s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK’s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2075</funded_amount><paid_amount>2075</paid_amount><image><id>249200</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Consegue um rendimento mensal de 15000,00mt e ainda não faz poupanças.&#10;&#10;Sábado solicita empréstimo pela terceira vez na Hluvuku e primeira no Kiva, onde sonha ampliar o seu negocio e futuramente pretende abrir outro estabelecimento numa zona vizinha. &#10;</pt><en>Sábado Samuel M. was born in the province of Gaza. He is 39 years old and the father of 8 children, who are all in school. Besides his children, he also supports his paternal grandparents by sending them food supplies. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sábado studied until the 4th grade and then his parents made him stop because their zone only went until the 4th grade and to continue meant to leave the zone. So they prohibited him from continuing so that he would stay and take care of the cattle. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sábado moved from Gaza province to Maputo when he got very sick and went to stay at a sister’s house. When he got better he was able to get a job with Mozambique railways, which ended when the company decided to reduce the number of employees. He was given severance pay and with that money he purchased a plot of land where he built his house and a small business raising chickens and selling basic goods. With this loan he intends to increase his stock. Sábado is able to earn a monthly income of 15,000.00 MT, but is still not able to save any money. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is Sábado’s third loan through Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. His dream is to increase his business so that in the future he can open another establishment in a neighboring zone. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Portuguese

She has been doing so for 20 years.  Her mother started the business but due to her age she decided to leave the business in her daughter&apos;s hands and this is how Martha ended up in the business.  She sells to her neighbours and to her mother&apos;s customers and is now trying to get working capital to keep the business and not lose it as it is the business which provides the income necessary to support her family and to repay the commitments she has made to Fundación León 2000.

Con el dinero solicitado comprará más granos para sembrar y abonos (guano y urea) para que sus productos crezcan fuertes. </es><en>Joel is 33 years old and the father of three children.  He lives with his partner who is hugely helpful to him, above all on their farm.  Joel grows maize and rice and raises livestock.  He&apos;s been doing this difficult work since he was 3 years old.  The thing that pleases him most is taking good care of his crops and animals since a good appearance might fetch a better price.  And since his products, once in the market, are in much demand by his customers, he&apos;s right to take care.  This is Joel&apos;s second MFP loan, having been responsible in repaying the first loan.  He will use the funds to buy seeds and fertilizers (guano and urea) so that his products grow strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>325</funded_amount><paid_amount>325</paid_amount><image><id>249477</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Buy seeds and fertilizers for farming business.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>PUCALLPA</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.379147 -74.553866</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2009-01-03T01:50:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>325</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Joel</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-12-04T08:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>325</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>152.16</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>155.74</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>164.99</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>169</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-05-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>175.51</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-06-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>182.6</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>49.45</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50.62</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>53.62</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>54.92</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>57.04</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>59.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>49.45</amount><local_amount>152.16</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T13:59:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>154.03</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10228274</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>50.62</amount><local_amount>155.74</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T20:01:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>157.65</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20423506</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>53.62</amount><local_amount>164.99</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T20:31:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167.02</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27116768</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>54.92</amount><local_amount>169</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-02T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T21:40:15Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>171.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36011699</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>57.04</amount><local_amount>175.51</local_amount><processed_date>2009-05-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-06-16T01:02:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>177.67</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44595305</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>59.35</amount><local_amount>182.6</local_amount><processed_date>2009-06-02T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-07-15T22:37:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>184.84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>52989524</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2009-01-03T05:54:35Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-07-15T22:37:09Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>82110</id><name>Juanita</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Juanita tiene 24 años, es soltera, vive con sus padres quienes se sienten muy orgullosos de tener una hija muy trabajadora.

She lives with her three single children, who work and help her a lot. She was raising chickens, but because this wasn&apos;t very productive, she also decided to sell beverages (sodas and beers), something she started doing just two months ago. The thing she likes about her work is giving her customers good service and maintaining a friendship with them. Besides, her new business of selling drinks is very profitable, as her products are in high demand. In general, it&apos;s going well for her. This loan will be her 10th loan from Kiva partner Microfinanzas Prisma, and since she began working with her communal bank, she has shown herself to be responsible and timely in making payments. With the money she is requesting this time, she will begin construction on a location for her drink sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Olivia Engkvist, Kiva

After attaining a certificate in hairdressing eight years back, she raised some capital and opened up Eva’s Beauty Salon in Kibuli. She is a specialist in plaiting, weaving, treatment, retouching and curling kit. On her price list, plaiting and weaving rank highest at 15,000 Ugandan shillings (about $USD7.50) per head. In the good seasons, like the months of November, December, January, May and August, she makes an average of 200,000 Ugandan shillings per day - a little over $USD100; in lean seasons, she makes UGX20,000. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Eva will use this loan to replenish her stock of cosmetics - hair relaxers, hair treatment, deodorants, perfumes, foundation powders and nail varnishes - and hair additions - afro kinky, hi yaki, babe cut, Abuja braids, pony braids and human hair. Eva wins over her customers by ensuring good services. She works hard to ensure she provides for her family. Her dream is expanding her salon into a modern fully equipped one, hoping that it will yield more income to enable her family to live a good life.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Eva will share this loan with the four other members of her group.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>249883</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Beauty

With five years&apos; experience in the business, she has gained popularity for her affordable but delicious and mouth-watering dishes. Her menu comprises matooke, katogo, chapatti, posho, rice, lumonde, cassava, vegetables, beef, chicken and fish among others. A plate of food goes for 1,000 Ugandan shillings (about 50 US cents) from which she earns a profit of 300 shillings.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Prescade is using the proceeds of this loan to purchase rice, green bananas for preparing matooke and maize flour for posho. She buys her supplies from Kikubamutwe market. The growth of her business is mainly attributed to good customer relationships and hygiene. She has employed two jovial, young ladies as waitresses.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Prescade is a single mother of  six. She dreams of supplying green bananas to the market vendors to supplement her restaurant income. With a stable source of income, her desire will be to see her family prosper in all aspects of life.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Prescade will share this loan with the four other members of her

B-Revocate Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Revocate B. is 30 years old. She is a hardworking and popular fishmonger in Kalanzi zone. Every morning, she travels 15 kilometers to Ggaba – a landing site on the shores of Lake Victoria – to purchase various types of fish such as tilapia, nile perch, mukeene and kolongo. When she gets back to her stall she dries and smokes some of the tilapia and also slices some of the nile perch into small, affordable pieces of various sizes which she later deep fries in the evening from 5pm-9pm, her peak business hours. This is aimed at meeting the diverse tastes and preferences of her customers.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;From fish worth 100,000 Ugandan shillings (about USD$50), Revocate gets a profit of 50,000 shillings. At the moment, she is using the loan proceeds to purchase more fish hoping for increased sales and increased profits. She is a married mother of four and she also takes care of her parents. Her ambition is to become a supplier of both fish and green bananas to the market vendors. She hopes that when her dream comes true she will build a modern residence for her family.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Revocate will share this loan with the four other members of her group.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>249889</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fish

She is 27 years old, married with two children and a loving guardian to four of her orphaned nephews. She has five years&apos; experience in making ladies garments like gomeses, bitenges and vikoi, including school uniforms for both girls and boys. In most cases, she purchases yards of materials from which she makes various designs of clothes and sells them to the immediate customers. To boost her business, Specioza is using the loan funds to purchase more materials especially silk, cotton and linen to enable her to make many clothes and meet the demands of her customers. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;From sales of 60,000 Ugandan shillings (about USD$30) Specioza gets a profit of approximately 20,000 shillings. She plans well for her income and ensures she meets the basic needs of her family alongside her husband’s contribution. She aspires to open up a boutique selling imported designer wear, hoping that it will yield enough income for her to send her children and nephews to good schools.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Specioza will share this loan with the other members of her group.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>475</funded_amount><paid_amount>475</paid_amount><image><id>249890</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Sewing</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To

She has three years&apos; experience in preparing local dishes like luwombo, matooke, groundnut sauce, smoked fish and beef among others. When she sells food worth 80,000 Ugandan shillings (about USD$40) she gets a profit of approximately 30,000. Babra will use the loan proceeds to purchase rice, flour and cooking oil. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Babra underwent a catering course in Kampala after which her husband raised some capital for her to set up the restaurant. She is a mother of three and also looks after her late sister’s daughter. Her husband is a supplier of green bananas to market vendors. Her ambition is to venture into selling secondhand shoes imported from abroad. She also desires to send all her children to boarding schools.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Babra will share this loan with the other three members of her

B1- Nalugo Victor Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Forty-year-old Victor N. is a banana vendor in Kabalagala market. She sells two types of bananas, namely bogoya and ndizi. Before she started this business, she used to have a restaurant in the same locality from which she accumulated the capital to start this business. She attracts her customers by ensuring good services, attractive display, healthy fruits and a hygienic environment.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Victor is using this loan to purchase bogoya and ndizi to add to her stock. She purchases the fruits from the Masaka suppliers. When she sells bananas worth 400,000 Ugandan shillings (about USD$200), she earns an average of 100,000 shillings profit. Her ambition is to remain in the same business but as a supplier. Being a single mother of four and a guardian to one orphan, she hopes that when she fulfills her ambition, she will be in a position to educate the five children and offer them a decent home and life.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Victor will share this loan with the other members of her group.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>249919</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits

Secondary School Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>The members of this loan group are all teachers at the Ahmadiyya Secondary School in Makeni. The school was founded in 1984 by the Ahmadiyya Mission. Today, it has a total of 364 pupils with a staff of 10 teachers. The school carries a lot of pride for its ability to resurrect itself from the ruins of the civil war to become one of the most enviable schools in town. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is the second time teachers from Ahmadiyya have received a loan from SMT. The previous loan was a great success to the first borrowers, hence three more staff have decided to join their colleagues this time around to borrow from SMT. Hawanatu S., for example, was able to start a small business using the previous loan. Today, her business serves as a supplementary source of income to her. Pa L. invested his money in agriculture and this has also served as an additional source of income to him outside of the classroom. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Fifty-one year old Naziru C. (on the left in the photo) is the principal at the school. He was born in Taiama, in the Moyamba district in southern Sierra Leone. He is married with five children. Two of the children are in junior secondary school, two are in senior secondary school and one is in college. His wife is also currently studying at the university. Naziru will use his loan to purchase house building materials, specifically cement for bricks and iron rods. He’ll also hire four or five laborers to do the work. He wants to build an apartment adjacent to his home consisting of two rooms and a parlor. Naziru travels to Freetown every weekend where his family resides. He’ll purchase the building materials there where the prices are lower relative to Makeni. A bag of cement, for example, will cost him 35,000 Leones (about USD$11.50) versus 45,000 to 50,000 in Makeni.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Government salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivation is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classroom have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either business or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (although this is a practice the government is trying to stop). Needless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or invest in something productive. Many want to do more schooling, but cannot afford the cost. Some want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs. And with their monthly salaries, they can easily repay the loan via a payroll deduction type of system.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2003, after the rebel forces left the town, Ahmadiyya school could only boast of having five teachers, thus making the school’s performance on national exams very poor. But with the intervention of the new principal, Naziru C., Ahmadiyya today has a total of 10 staff. In last year’s national exams (also known as BECE – Basic Education Certification Examination) the school had two pupils who obtained some of the highest marks on the exams. This was a clear statement to bigger schools whose pupils could not score such high grades. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the sporting arena, Ahamdiyya Secondary School is the current holder of the soccer competition trophy organized by the Ministry of Education, Youths and Sports for Junior Secondary Schools. They defeated the AL-Harrkan Secondary School. Because of all their hard work and dedication to both academics and extra-curricular activities, the school was upgraded to a senior secondary school by the Ministry of Education last academic year.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>3200</funded_amount><paid_amount>3200</paid_amount><image><id>249924</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Construction
