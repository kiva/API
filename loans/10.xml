He is 43 years old and lives with his wife and six school-aged children.  Dr. O. was employed by the government for the first three years of his career.  He then worked at a private hospital for six years before starting his own practice in 1997.  He ran his health facility on a part-time basis using it primarily for admissions, while his main practice remained in the center of town.  He gradually focused his efforts on building a larger out-patient facility as a part of this practice, and eventually shifted his clientele there two and a half years ago.  Besides general curative services and an observation ward, his facility offers a pharmacy, a laboratory, and maternal and child health services.  Dr. O. attributes his success to hard work, perseverance and assistance from KMET’s previous two microfinance loans.  He has been able to expand his facility, increase the number of services he offers, and improve the quality of care he provides.  Dr. O. carries a very good reputation from the many years of good work he has been doing in Kisumu.  His practice continues to grow as he attracts more corporate clients as well as private patients.  As he plans to further expand his facility, he has applied for a loan of Kshs 84,000 (approximately US$1.200) to purchase more advanced laboratory equipment, primarily, a calorimeter, in order to accommodate a greater variety of patients and more difficult cases.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>15760</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Medical

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>R. is 32 years old, and is married with two children, both girls aged 15 and 10. The eldest is attending senior high school, while the younger one is in elementary school. Her husband, Salim, does not have a fixed job, so he does odd jobs, carrying goods and off-loading trucks when he can.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;R. buys waste material like plastic cups, plastic bottles, cardboard and paper from her neighbors and other houses in the village. Her husband uses a cart to collect scrap metal and other waste material. Households do not just give away waste material, because there is demand and therefore economic value in recycling. So the more working capital they have, the more scrap they can collect and recycle. Their own working capital is limited, at around $250. Having heard from her friends about MBK, R. has now applied to MBK to add to her working capital. Since this is the first time, R. can only borrow a maximum of $75 from MBK.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The recycling business consists of the following chain. R. and her husband are the first link in this chair, buying waste and scrap materials from households, sorting and cleaning them, before selling them to an intermediate dealer. This dealer comes around in a small truck, collects the sorted-out material and takes it to the warehouse dealer. There, the different materials are weighed in front of R.’s husband, who then gets paid by the intermediate dealer. The warehouse dealer in turn sends the waste material to various processing factories, which turn produce clean and reusable recycled paper, cardboard and plastic recycled raw materials. Waste recycling undertaken by R. and her husband thus helps clean the environment by reusing waste material which otherwise would go to the landfills.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>75</funded_amount><paid_amount>75</paid_amount><image><id>15707</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Plastics

After school he worked as an engineer. This experience helped him start his own business. Vladimir runs a small workshop manufacturing iron railings, grates, fences, etc. He has been in this business since 1996. Vladimir was one of the first entrepreneurs working in this sphere of business in the region. His turnover capital currently amounts to $4,000. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Vladimir is very orderly, punctual and determined. He has a team of three employees working for him. Top rate manufactured products and flexibility in working with clients have ensured the success of Vladimir’s enterprise. Eight loans from “Nadiya Ukraine” have also contributed to expansion of his business.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Vladimir would like to get a loan of $1,000 to purchase metal roll used in manufacturing ornamental ironwork. The loan will help him increase his sales and gain additional profit. Vladimir is planning to invest generated funds in a second workshop manufacturing iron gates, railings, frames, fire grates and pokers. Age-old craft coupled with contemporary design will make this ironwork very unique and suitable to any customer’s taste, environment and budget requirements. It should also be mentioned that Vladimir has been a loyal donor to the Ukrainian Association for the Visually Handicapped for several years. Funds generated by the business will allow him to provide more financial assistance to partially sighted and blind people ensuring that impaired vision does not result in an impaired life. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Володимир – одружений, в нього є син. Після університету, він працював інженером. Отриманий досвід допоміг йому почати власну справу. Володимир – власник невеличкої майстерні, він займається виробництвом металевих огорож, поруччя, гратів тощо ще з 1996 року. Володимир почав працювати в цій сфері бізнесу одним з перших серед інших підприємців. Його робочий капітал складає 4000 доларів. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Володимир – дуже зібраний, пунктуальний та наполегливий. Він працює разом з трьома іншими чоловіками. Високоякісні вироби та гнучкість в роботі з клієнтами забезпечують успіх в роботі. Вісім позик, які Володимир отримав від „Надії України”, також сприяли зростанню його бізнесу.    &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Володимир хотів би отримати позику в 1000 доларів для того, щоб купити металопрокат, який використовується для виготовлення декоративних металевих виробів. Позика допоможе йому збільшити обсяг продажів та заробити додатковий прибуток. Володимир планує вкласти зароблені кошти в роботу другої майстерні з вироблення металевих воріт, поруччя, рамок, камінних решіток тощо. Стародавні технології у поєднанні з сучасним дизайном підкреслять неповторність кожного деталі. Широкий вибір виробів на будь-який смак стане по кишені кожному та прикрасить будь-яку оселю. Варто також додати, що Володимир – постійний спонсор Товариства Сліпих України. Тому він планує передати  частину коштів, які отримає від своєї діяльності, на допомогу людям, які частково або повністю втратили зір. Ця фінансова підтримка допоможе багатьом з ним відчути на собі, що послаблений зір – це не перешкода для повноцінного життя.     &#13;&#10;  &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>15742</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Blacksmith</activity><sector>Manufacturing</sector><use>To purchase metal roll to produce railings</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Stryi</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-02-15T17:31:17Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Vladimir</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-02T23:18:46Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>334</amount><local_amount>334</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-18T09:10:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-18T09:17:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13224</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>334</amount><local_amount>334</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-18T09:16:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-18T09:17:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>24121</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-18T09:17:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-18T09:17:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>33327</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>165</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-18T09:17:30Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-18T09:17:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>165</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44033</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-02-16T23:18:46Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-18T09:17:30Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>4665</id><name>Svitlana</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Svitlana is a divorced mother with two daughters. Her husband left their family 13 years ago and she was forced to find ways to provide for herself and her daughters. She was familiar with the clothing retail business so she decided to borrow some money and start her own business selling clothes. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Svitlana has been self-employed now for more than 5 years. She is very strong-willed and resolute. Her hard work, perseverance and ability to offer a wide assortment of clothing have helped her keep loyal clientele and expand her business. Presently, Svitlana has about $2,000 of working capital. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Svitlana is requesting a loan of $800 to allow her to increase her inventory and to help open a new vending kiosk in another local market. She can purchase men and women’s clothing in bulk for good prices. If she is able to open a second sales kiosk, her sales activity will increase greatly and she will be able to meet the needs of more customers.  This loan will give Svitlana a chance to expand her trade, increase profits, and invest in her business and her family’s future welfare.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Світлана – розлучена, в неї дві дочки. Її чоловік покинув родину ще 13 років тому. Отже, Світлана була змушена шукати можливостей забезпечувати себе та донечок. Вона зналася на одязі, тому вирішила позичити грошей та відкрити власну справу.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Світлана працює сама на себе вже більше 5 років. Вона – дуже вольова та рішуча. Наполеглива праця та великий асортимент одягу допомогли їй зберегти вірних клієнтів та розширити власний бізнес. Зараз в Світлани – 2000 доларів в товарі.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Світлана просить про позику в 800 доларів для того, щоб поповнити асортимент товарів та відкрити ще один кіоск на місцевому ринку. Вона планує оптом закупити чоловічий та жіночий одяг за помірними цінами. Коли вона відкриє другий кіоск, обсяг продаж значно виросте, а отже, вона зможе задовольнити попит багатьох покупців. Позика надасть Світлані можливість розширити торгівлю, збільшити прибутки, вкласти зароблені кошти в  розвиток бізнесу та забезпечити потреби родини.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>15743</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To open another vending kiosk</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Stryi</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-02-15T17:31:36Z</posted_date><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Svitlana</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-04T01:14:31Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>800</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>268</amount><local_amount>268</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-18T09:10:46Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-18T09:17:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>268</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13225</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>268</amount><local_amount>268</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-18T09:16:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-18T09:17:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>268</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>24122</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-18T09:17:28Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-18T09:17:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>33328</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>130</amount><local_amount>130</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-18T09:17:32Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-18T09:17:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>130</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44034</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-02-18T01:14:31Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-18T09:17:32Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>4666</id><name>Ilya</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Ilya is married with a three-year old son. Creative thinking and designer’s talent motivated him to start his business manufacturing advertising billboards and signs. He has been in this business for 5 years. A systematic approach and the use of modern technologies have helped Ilya make his small business successful. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ilya is very determined and precise. He sets high goals and invests all his energy in realizing those goals. Ilya currently has three employees and rents a workshop which helps him run his business more efficiently. His working capital amounts to $1,600. Ilya has received and promptly repaid 23 loans from “Nadiya Ukraine”.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ilya is requesting a loan of $1,000 to purchase some new equipment, such as electric drills and fretsaws because the tools he’s been using are old and need frequent repairs. New equipment will give him more flexibility and improve the quality of the services his business provides. This will allow him to serve new customers and generate more profit. Ilya would like to use some of the added income to finish the remodeling of his apartment. Ilya believes his perseverance and hard work in combination with financial assistance will also help him fulfill his next goal - to open a second advertising business in a new city.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ілля – одружений, в нього трьохрічний син. Креативне мислення та талант дизайнера дали йому змогу почати власний бізнес з виробництва рекламних щитів та вивісок. Він займається цим бізнесом вже 5 років. Систематичний підхід та використання сучасних технологій спряли успішному зростанню бізнесу Іллі. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ілля – дуже наполегливий та розсудливий. Він ставить важливі цілі та вкладає усю свою енергію в їхнє досягнення. Разом з Іллею працюють також три інших чоловіка, вони працюють в орендованій майстерні. В матеріали в нього зараз вкладено 1600 доларів. Ілля отримав та вчасно сплатив 23 позики від „Надії України”.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ілля просить про позику в 1000 доларів для того, щоб придбати необхідне нове обладнання, а саме: електричні дрилі та лобзики, тому ще інструменти, які він використовував, вже застарі та постійно ламаються. Нове обладнання зробить бізнес Іллі мобільним та значно покращить якість послуг, які він пропонує. Це допоможе йому обслуговувати більше клієнтів та отримувати додатковий прибуток. Ілля також планує частину зароблених коштів в облаштування власної квартири. Він переконаний, що наполеглива праця у поєднанні з фінансовою підтримкою допоможуть йому досягти поставленої мети – відкрити ще одну рекламну агенцію на новому ринку.    &#13;&#10;    &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>15745</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Services</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To purchase electric equipment</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Stryi</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-02-15T17:31:53Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ilya</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-07T23:54:30Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>334</amount><local_amount>334</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-22T09:25:53Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-22T09:16:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13502</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>334</amount><local_amount>334</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-22T09:15:54Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-22T09:16:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>25347</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-22T09:16:40Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-22T09:16:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>34321</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>165</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-22T09:16:36Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-22T09:16:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>165</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>45207</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-02-21T23:54:30Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-22T09:16:36Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>4667</id><name>Vakil</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>58-year-old Vakil with his 2 children settled in Sumgait city.

She runs a small business in Kherson, Ukraine selling clothing for men and women. Her kiosk is located in one of the busiest city markets where multiple vendors offer almost every imaginable product to passing customers. A beautiful array of assorted clothes attracts many clients to Irina’s kiosk. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Irina is a hard-worker and a talented business manager. She has maintained an excellent credit history with “Nadiya Ukraine” without any defaults. Irina is very devoted to the success of her business and we believe she will have no problem keeping a perfect credit record. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Irina is requesting the above amount to improve her business by stocking more clothing items which will allow her to expand her business and clientele. This financial contribution will not only have a positive impact on the business profitability, but it will go further amd improve the social and economic status of Irina, her employees and their families. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ірина – одружена, в неї є син. Вона – власниця кіоску в Херсоні, займається продажем чоловічого та жіночого одягу. Її торгове місце знаходиться на одному з найбільших ринків, де покупцям можуть запропонувати найрізноманітніші продукти та товари. Широкий вибір різноманітного одягу приваблює багатьох потенційних покупців до кіоску Ірини.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ірина – дуже працьовита, вона талановитий бізнес менеджер. Під час роботи з „Надією України” вона встигла зарекомендувати себе як дуже відповідальна людина, яка завжди сплачує позики вчасно. Ірина віддана успіху своєї справи, в неї не буде жодних проблем зі сплатою отриманої позики. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ірина хотіла б отримати поизику для того, щоб закупити більше одягу, що допоможе їй розширити клієнтську базу та покращити свій бізнес. Цей фінансовий внесок не тільки позитивно вплине на прибутковість бізнесу Ірини, але й в подальшому сприятиме покращенню економічного та соціального статусу її підлеглих та рідних. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>15812</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To increase her turnover capital</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Kherson</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>46.633333 32.6</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-02-17T18:07:22Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Irina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-10T14:14:51Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>334</amount><local_amount>334</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-26T09:25:38Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13939</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-26T09:17:09Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>17418</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-26T09:17:41Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26218</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-26T09:18:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35592</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>165</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-26T09:19:05Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>165</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>46553</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-02-24T14:14:51Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-26T09:19:05Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>4683</id><name>Irina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Irina is married with one daughter. After school she was unable to find a good paying job in her field of training so she decided to start her own business selling jean clothing. She has been in business now for 4 years. Trendy clothes and her natural friendliness have helped her business be successful. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Irina is very cheerful and resolute. Her main goal is to provide a level of customer friendly service that exceeds her clients’ expectations, creates repeat customers, and attracts new customers to her kiosk. Her entrepreneurial talent and hard work in combination with 10 loans from “Nadiya Ukraine” have helped promote the dynamic growth of her business.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Irina would like to purchase a new vending kiosk. This loan for $1,000 will allow her to purchase a kiosk and will increase her working capital so that she can expand her inventory of quality, durable jean shorts, jackets, jean sets etc. and better meet the growing demands of her clients. Successful, stable growth in Irina’s business will help provide a more secure future for her employees and family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ірина – одружена, в неї одна дочка. Вона певний час не могла знайти гарно оплачувану роботу за своєю спеціальністю, отже, вирішила відкрити власну справу й продавати джинсовий одяг. Ірина займається цим бізнесом вже 4 роки. Модний одяг та природна відкритість Ірини допомогли їй досягти успіху в бізнесі. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ірина – дуже жвава та рішуча. Вона завжди намагається запропонувати своїм покупцям високий рівень обслуговування, що допомагає їй зберегти постійних клієнтів та привабити нових.

She is a Technical school graduate and worked for a while as a design engineer, but was unable to earn a stable salary. Seeking another source of income, Ludmila decided to start her own small business. She rented a kiosk and began selling household chemicals. Recently, however, Ludmila decided to make a change in the type of products she offers and start selling knitted wear and caps. She believes this new area of trade will help her generate additional profit.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ludmila is very responsible and determined. She’s been in business for 11 years and can easily guess the preferences of her clients which helps build customer loyalty. Her integrity and perseverance have helped Ludmila keep her business stable allowing her to pay back 11 loans she has received from “Nadiya Ukraine”. Presently, Ludmila has around $1,000 of working capital. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ludmila would like to get a loan for $800 to buy more clothing products. She is planning to purchase knitted wear and warm caps that always sell well in Ukraine in the winter and spring. Her first month of sales with the new products was very successful which has encouraged Ludmila to proceed with this trade and expand her clothing sales business. This loan will help Ludmila’s business continue to grow ensuring the well-being of her family and helping to provide an education for her son at a good college.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Людмила – одружена, в неї один син. Вона закінчила технікум та певний час працювала інженером-проектувальником. Однак, зарплатню вона отримувала дуже нестабільно. В пошуках інших джерел заробітку Людмила вирішила почати власну справу. Вона орендувала кіоск та почала торгівлю побутовою хімією. Нещодавно Людмила вирішила змінити тип товарів та продавати трикотажні вироби. Вона вважає, що ця нова сфера торгівлі допоможе їй отримати додатковий прибуток. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Людмила – дуже відповідальна та наполеглива. Вона займається цим бізнесом вже 11 років, може легко передбачити побажання клієнтів, що допомагає їй зберегти постійних покупців. Чесність та відданість своїй справі забезпечили стабільність бізнесу Людмили та допомогли їй вчасно сплатити 11 позик, які вона отримала від „Надії України”. В товар в неї вкладено 1000 доларів.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Людмила просить про позику в 800 доларів для того, щоб купити більше одягу. Вона планує закупити трикотажні вироби та теплі шапки, які завжди користуються попитом в Україні під час зимового та весняного періодів. Перший місяць продажу виявився дуже успішним. Отже, Людмила вирішила продовжувати торгівлю та розширити бізнес з продажу одягу. Ця позика сприятиме подальшому зростанню бізнесу Людмили, а також забезпечить добробут її родини та навчання сина в гарному навчальному закладі. &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>15818</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home Products Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To increase clothing inventory</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Zaporozhye</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-02-19T01:34:26Z</posted_date><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ludmila</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-09T17:55:46Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>800</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>268</amount><local_amount>268</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-26T09:25:39Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>268</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13940</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-26T09:17:10Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>17419</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-26T09:17:42Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26219</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-26T09:18:13Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35593</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>130</amount><local_amount>130</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-26T09:19:06Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>130</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>46554</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-02-23T17:55:46Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-26T09:19:06Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>4685</id><name>Mariya</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mariya is married and tragically has just lost her only son. She tries to do everything she can to support her daughter-in-law in the loss they have both experienced. Mariya is retired from her career work, but her retirement income was not sufficient to meet the needs of her family. To supplement her pension she decided to take a risk and start her own business selling winter clothing. She rented a kiosk in one of the busiest city markets, purchased some merchandise to sell and started back to work.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mariya is persistent and hard-working. She has received and promptly repaid all loans from “Nadiya Ukraine”. She has now been in business for 10 years and currently has around $1,500 of working capital for her business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mariya is requesting a loan of $700 to increase her clothing stock in preparation for the spring season. She is planning to buy quality jackets, coats and sweaters that are both durable and trendy. A wider assortment of merchandise will boost sales and expand Mariya’s business. The loan will not only improve the quality of her selection and attract more customers, but will go further to help Mariya meet the needs of her family and provide a better livelihood for them. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Марія – одружена. Вона нещодавно втратила свого єдиного сина. Зараз вона намагається всіма силами підтримати свою невістку. Марія вже на пенсії, але грошей, які вона отримує їй не вистачає для того, щоб забезпечити потреби родини. Отже, вона вирішила ризикнути та почати власний бізнес з продажу зимового одягу. Марія орендувала кіоск на одному з найбільших ринків міста, закупила товар та почала працювати. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Марія – дуже наполеглива та працьовита. Вона отримала та вчасно сплатила всі позики від „Надії України”. Вона займається цим бізнесом вже 10 років.

Вона планує закупити якісні куртки, пальта та светри, які будуть довговічними й модними. Розширення асортименту товарів обов’язково сприятиме збільшенню обсягів продажу та розширенню бізнесу Марії.  Позика допоможе не тільки обновити товар та привабити більше покупців, але й допоможе Марії забезпечити потреби родини та якісно покращити рівень їхнього життя.  &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>15819</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To increase clothing stock </use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Zaporozhye</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-02-19T01:36:09Z</posted_date><loan_amount>700</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Mariya</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-07T01:19:24Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>700</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>700</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>234</amount><local_amount>234</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-21T09:25:59Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-21T09:17:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>234</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13436</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>234</amount><local_amount>234</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-21T09:16:32Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-21T09:17:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>234</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>24701</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>117</amount><local_amount>117</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-21T09:16:57Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-21T09:17:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>117</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>34108</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>115</amount><local_amount>115</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-21T09:17:22Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-21T09:17:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>115</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44993</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-02-21T01:19:24Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-21T09:17:22Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>4686</id><name>Tatyana</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Tatyana is married with two children.

Together with loans from “Nadiya Ukraine”, she has been able to increase her inventory and sales volume. Presently, she has about $1,500 of working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to around $200.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tatyana is requesting a loan for $500 that will allow her to increase her assortment of inventory for the spring season. She is planning to buy sweaters, caps and purses in bulk for further retail sales. She would also like to purchase small items such as electric light bulbs, matches, plastic bags and a variety of other little necessities that always sell so well and will supplement her clothing sales.

Тетяна також хотіла б придбати різні дрібні товари, наприклад, електричні лампочки, запальнички, сірники, пакети та різноманітні товари, які знадобляться в побуті. До того ж вона планує урізноманітнити асортимент одиниць одягу. Позика допоможе Тетяні збільшити обсяги товару, задовольнити зростаючий попит з боку покупців, а також сприятиме стабільному розвитку її бізнесу.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>15826</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To purchase wider assortment of inventory</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Novaya Kahovka</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-02-22T22:09:10Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Tatyana</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-11T01:03:56Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>168</amount><local_amount>168</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-26T09:25:40Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>168</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13941</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-26T09:17:11Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>17420</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-26T09:17:43Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26220</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-26T09:18:15Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35594</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-26T09:19:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-26T09:19:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>46555</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-02-25T01:03:56Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-26T09:19:08Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>4687</id><name>Yanina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Yanina is married with one son. After completing schooling, both she and her husband were unable to find good paying jobs due to high unemployment rates in Ukraine. The family was forced to look for other sources of income to provide for their needs. Yanina’s husband went abroad in search of work. Yanina had always wanted to be self-employed so she decided to start her own business selling women’s lingerie. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has been in this business for about a year. Her polite manner and natural cheerfulness have helped Yanina generate clientele and operate her business successfully. Loans from “Nadiya Ukraine” have been a big help as she’s established and begun to expand her business.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To meet growing demand from her customers, Yanina is requesting a loan of $500 which will allow her to purchase more silk, cotton and linen underwear at wholesale prices. Her goal is to increase her turnover capital which will allow her to purchase additional merchandise at affordable prices. Good quality women’s lingerie at discounted prices will attract many potential customers and boost Yanina’s sales promoting the consistent growth of her business and providing stable income for her family.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Яніна – одружена, в неї один син. Після університету вона та її чоловік не могли знайти гарно оплачувану роботу через високий рівень безробіття в Україні. Отже, вони були змушені шукати інші джерела прибутку для того, щоб забезпечити потреби родини. Чоловік Яніни поїхав за кордон в пошуках заробітку. Яніна вирішила працювати на себе, почала власний бізнес з продажу білизни для жінок.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Вона займається цим бізнесом вже десь рік. Її ввічливість та природна жвавість допомогли Яніні знайти свого покупця та досягти успіху в бізнесі. Позики від „Надії України” також сприяли поступовому розвитку та розширенню її бізнесу.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Для того, щоб задовольнити зростаючий попит, Яніна просить про позику в 500 доларів. Ці кошти дадуть їй змогу придбати більше білизни з шовку, бавовни та льону за оптовими цінами. Яніна планує збільшити робочий капітал та придбати більше товару за помірним цінами. Якісна жіноча білизна за низькими цінами привабить багато нових потенційних покупців та сприятиме зростанню темпів продажу, що, в свою чергу, забезпечить стабільний ріст бізнесу Яніни та допоможе отримати додаткові прибутки. &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>15827</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To increase inventory </use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Novaya Kahovka</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-02-26T07:12:18Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Yanina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-14T01:15:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>168</amount><local_amount>168</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-28T09:25:56Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-28T09:16:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>168</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14132</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-28T09:15:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-28T09:16:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>18131</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-28T09:15:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-28T09:16:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26712</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-28T09:16:15Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-28T09:16:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36286</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-28T09:16:33Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-28T09:16:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>47347</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-02-28T02:15:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-28T09:16:33Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>4688</id><name>Elizabeth</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Lizzy sells local maize meal known as kenkey to a large community of about 2,600 people.

The area where he lives is prone to malaria and waterborne diseases like cholera and amoebic dysentery, so drugs for these diseases have a high turnover in his pharmacy.

She is married and has five children. Two are in primary school, another two are in secondary school and the last one is in kindergarten. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Hellena owns a retail shop selling various consumable items, mainly food. She has operated her shop for more than six years now. The shop has been the main source of income for the family.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her husband is a commuter bus driver - his income cannot meet the numerous family demands. She recently realized that her shop&apos;s profit margin has been decreasing because of an increased number of competitors.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In a plan to improve her profit margin, Hellena has decided to expand the shop by adding different categories of food items.  She has noticed that her customers travel a long way to the market to look for food items which could easily be stocked in her shop. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her new strategy needs additional capital. From her own savings, Hellena has managed to finance 20% of the business plan. She needs $550 to make up the difference.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She expects this strategy will enable her make more income so that she can meet her family requirements and pay school fees for her children. She has a dream of becoming a big wholeseller in her area.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>15915</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Add to stocks of food items</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Dar es Salaam</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-6.8 39.283333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>10</partner_id><posted_date>2007-02-20T05:00:47Z</posted_date><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Hellena</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-07T12:07:09Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>550</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>184</amount><local_amount>184</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-25T09:26:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-25T09:15:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>184</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13699</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>184</amount><local_amount>184</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-25T09:15:39Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-25T09:15:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>184</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>25824</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>92</amount><local_amount>92</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-25T09:15:34Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-25T09:15:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>92</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35101</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>90</amount><local_amount>90</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-25T09:15:44Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-25T09:15:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>90</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>45984</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-02-21T12:07:09Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-25T09:15:44Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>4696</id><name>Sharifa</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Sharifa lives in Mbagala, Temeke District in Dar es Salaam.

Her goal in life is to see her children graduate from college or vocational training and become independent. She has had training in business techniques, credit and management skills, and has experience-sharing sessions at Center meetings organized by GHAPE. She was given a loan of $40 in 2005 and $130 in 2006. She is proud of having succeeded in selling foodstuff like vegetables, cocoyam, and pepper to the people of her immediate community, and for having paid her children’s tuition.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With a loan of $800, she plans to increase her stock by buying cocoyam, yam, ibo-cocoyam in bags from the “bush market” (farmers’ market); buckets for measuring and bags for parceling; and setting aside money for transportation. She is optimistic that her business will succeed as she will be able to supply different types of customers daily 24/7. With the experience each member of the household has in this business, her children will sell from the house and she will sell in the flea market.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She plans to pay her loan in 18 months. The first repayment installment shall be made on the fourth month from the date of disbursement of the loan. &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>15935</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Selling raw food items for humans</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Musang, Bamenda, NW.

On top of running her household, she manages a small store attached to the front of her house. It is a specialty items store featuring office supplies, accessories for making crafts, and personal hygiene products. The loan will be used to expand the inventory of her business. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She lives in a neighborhood called Chavón in the Los Alcarrizos barrio (neighborhood) of Santo Domingo province in the Dominican Republic. Her three eldest daughters attend school and enjoy playing baseball and other outdoor activities with their friends. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;NOTE: Laura is a member of the &quot;La Emresaria&quot; group, along with four other entrepreneurs.  They will be accountable to one another for paying back their loan of $750. This group lending method requires group members to help one another throughout the loan repayment process. Loans are paid back as a group. If one person is deficient on their loan, the group must make up the difference. Everyone in Laura&apos;s group has gone through Esperanza&apos;s training and proven to be responsible and determined to not only pay back their loan, but also to provide for their children.&lt;p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>15958</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home

&lt;i&gt;colmado&lt;/i&gt;. On the weekends, their five daughters lend a hand by weighing orders of rice or sugar on the scales or giving customers their change of pesos out of the cash box.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Hipolito has built the store in front of his home along a street the neighborhood of Chavon - a populated town with a large market for small businesses. The family colmado caters to a variety of needs, from cooking ingredients to canned food and beverages. With this new loan, Hipolito can expand his inventory of household products such as soap and shampoo, as well as refrigerated and perishable foods. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Hipolito and Reyna are trying to provide for their five daughters, ages 13, 11, 9, 8 and 6. Diversifying the store&apos;s inventory with this new loan will create more business and more profit on higher priced items. Meanwhile, their children are all in school and enjoy being a part of the family business.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;NOTE: As with most Esperanza loans, Hipolito is a member of a solidarity group, which receives and pays back equal shares of one loan. As well as Hipolito&apos;s business, this loan will go to four other entrepreneurs and their businesses. They formed their &quot;Banco de Esperanza&quot; (Bank of Hope), went through business training and will repay their loan together. If one person is unable to pay on time, they have their group to make up the difference.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>15960</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

She has a small selection at the moment, but with this new loan she will be able to afford more, to meet the needs of the surrounding communities. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her goal is to use the profits from this loan to create a self-sustainable business.  She wants to have enough money to buy medicine for her granddaughter, who has respiratory problems and poor blood circulation. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Luisa&apos;s hope is to work her way out of poverty and out of her house - a space equivelant to the size of a minivan for a family of six. This motivation, combined with her business training and reputation within her community, have made her a very good candidate for a loan.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;NOTE: Luisa has many friends in the community and is a leader of her solidarity group, called &apos;La Union&apos;.

Getting her children through school is her dream. She has received training in making koki (bean paste served with potatoes, cassava, plantain), business techniques, credit and other survival skills. With constant supervision and support from group members she took her first loan of $40 in 2003, and two subsequent loans in 2004 and 2005. From previous investment she succeeded in providing lunch at job sites.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With a loan of $600, she plans to increase her stock by buying a size-10 pot, a bag of beans, a drum of oil and plates. This mobile food selling will provide lunch, especially to manual laborers, at job sites in the community.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She plans to pay her loan in 18 months. The first repayment installment shall be made on the fourth month from the date of disbursement of the loan. &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>94165</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Buy beans, potatoes, cassava, and plantain to prepare koki</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Ndamukong, Bamenda, NW.

The death of both parents when she was still young left her with responsibilities that she was ill-prepared for. So getting younger ones and her children through school is her dream since she lost her parents. She has received training in crop cultivation, business techniques, credit and other survival skills. With constant supervision and support from group members she took her first loan of $40 in 2003, and two subsequent loans in 2004 and 2005. From previous investment she succeeded in providing lunch at job sites.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With a loan of $500, she plans to increase her stock by buying a truck load of firewood to provide dry cooking fuel to households in the community. She will also buy fertilizer, groundnut, yam, sweet yam and corn seeds. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She plans to pay her loan in 18 months. The first  repayment installment shall be made on the fourth month from the date of disbursement of the loan. &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>15984</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fuel/Firewood</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Firewood selling and crop cultivation</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Ngomgham, Bamenda, NW.

Some years ago he had an accident.   Because of that he is confined to a wheelchair, thus he has not been able to work as he used to before.  Then his wife became pregnant and was also unable to work.  Nevertheless, he began to sell packaged duritos and chips.

Emma has employed 2 of her sisters to help her out with her business, and uses her husband&apos;s family car for delivery.

She has a taro plantation business and aims to expand it. Her parents were doing the business but when they passed away years ago she continued growing taros to keep the business running. Faatolu’s husband went to New Zealand to seek employment to support his wife and children, but never returned to Samoa and abandoned her and her children. Faatolu had a difficult life trying to cope with what happened and bring up her children alone. The 5 children’s education was all financed by her taro plantation. Ever since Faatolu took over, the farm has expanded little by little and has now covered their 3 acres of land that was not being used. She is a serious woman and dedicated to her business to her parents. She will create employment opportunities within her business for her children when they can’t find a job.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>16298</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Buy

After school she was unable to find a good-paying job in her field of training, so she decided to start her own business of growing and selling bananas. She has been in business now for 2 years. With their support, her husband and her relatives have helped her business be successful. Her main goal is to provide the best bananas to meet her clients’ expectations, and to attract new customers to her market. Her existing clients that she has served for the past two years have helped promote the dynamic growth of her business.

She is eager to make improvements to her house by using wood, which is cheaper and affordable to buy. On her plantation, she also has livestock like chickens and pigs, which are being looked after by her husband’s brother, but she is mainly concentrating on planting taro, because she believes that the

Both her husband and she are self-employed in their business. Itagia came up with the idea of developing this business through our culture. In Samoan villages, we are not allowed to walk around with shorts; we must have a lavalava--a piece of material wrapped around the waist. From this Itagia came up the idea of printing flowers and different decorations on the lavalavas to persuade people to buy from her. Her business has become successful with not only the locals but also the tourists buying this lavalava  to wear as a sarong to the beach. She’s now aiming to learn more about printing on different types of materials and to expand her market

Although she was the only girl in her family, her father never treated her separately from her brothers. She was trained by her father with some farming skills. But as she grew up, she realized that her brothers had better skills than her in running the farm. She then asked her brothers to help her grow taros so she can run a taro plantation. Her three brothers have always helped  their sister with her every need. She’s now married with 5 children, still running her taro plantation and selling fruit. She hopes to be able to provide her children with a better education rather than the farming skills that she had been taught by her father.

Matila was employed at Sinalei Reef Resort ten years ago, and she resigned in the 1999 to take care of the grandchildren. From there she started growing vegetables beside the house, and this has now turned into a ½ acre vegetable garden, which  has developed into Matila’s everyday hobby. Now her grandchildren are all grown up, attending primary schools, but Matila has decided not to work for Sinalei but to work in her vegetable garden because she was one of their suppliers.

She has always enjoyed and been good at making Samoan oil (a therapeutic oil produced from coconut oil and essential oils of Samoan plants) that is mainly used by locals to massage and heal sick people. At first it wasn&apos;t easy because she needed more time to commit to making her local oil and she had little money. She wasn’t able to make her business a reality until she joined SPBD. Taei struggled to start her business but she didn&apos;t give up the battle and 2 years after beginning her business she continues the fight to increase it every day. She’s aiming to print her own labels to attach to the bottles so that people can easily order directly  straight from her. Her own recipe for making Samoan Oil will remain with her, and she hopes to pass it on to her children in the future.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>16316</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Perfumes</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Buy

Seeking another source of income, Taufau decided to start her own small business. She asked permission from her relatives for a piece of land she can use, and was granted a ½ acre plot to start her taro plantation. Taufau is a Christian lady who believes in the power of prayers. She began her business in 2004 and it is becoming really successful. She supplies taro to village people who make taro chips, and also supplies hotels nearby, and has found herself a market to export her Taro to our neighboring island that is under control by America. She believes her new market of trade will help her generate additional profit. Her main goal is for her business to grow, ensuring the wellbeing of her family and helping to provide an education for her son at a good

She’s a single mother of three sons. Telesia lives in a small open Samoan house with her sons. All the three sons are attending district school, and they love their mother so dearly that they always rush home after school to help their mother put together brooms.

Some days they wouldn’t be able to sell a single broom, so Telesia would send her eldest son to the market in the city of Apia to sell the brooms. One day Telesia was overwhelmed when she received a letter from a well-known business women in Samoa asking her to sign a 3-year supplier’s contract. Telesia is overjoyed that she has found herself a market, instead of her sons walking under the heat of the sun to sell her

He operates an open-air shop. His beginning business capital was USD 108. He began with a stock of 50 pairs of shoes, but stopped the business in 2000 due to the political and economical instability in Kinshasa. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Felly decided to resume his shoe business in 2004 and was informed by his friend about Hope’s loan program. He agreed to sign a loan contract with Hope. With his first Hope loan he stabilized his business by adding more pairs of shoes and diverse items such as boxes of batteries, small radios, shoe polish, padlocks, and other goods.

Financial assistance offered to her by SPBD helped set up the business. The initial $450 loan was used to buy meat (chicken, sausages, turkey tails) and taro for her stall.  Her husband also contributes financially to their family as he earns $100 fortnightly as a bus driver.  SPBD development programs and training assisted this family with knowledge, not only in financial assistance, but also with Victoria’s savings plan as she saves $10 each day from her business

Their sales proved to be worthwhile as they earn $50 each day from selling their fish to the villagers. The income helped pay for school for their 2 smaller children, as well as and family and church obligations. By improving their fishing gear and nets, Tanumia hopes to earn more from her fishing

They are raising 4 school-aged children, and are both employed. Her goal is for her children to get a good education that will benefit them in the long run. Sera was prompted to join the SPBD programme by the family&apos;s lack of money and other means of support. She decided to put her talent to good use with the help of her husband. Sera used her first loan to purchase plain materials, mostly lava (sarongs), screen-printed them, and sold them to individual shops. Because of the unique styles and beautiful colours, Sera’s business is booming - new orders are constantly being placed by her customers. She is now able to put her children through school and support her family financially. Sera is also looking to possibly expand her business by hiring 2 workers. And if she manages to save some extra money, Sera plans to expand her shop and even export her products to overseas markets. Currently, money is still a constraint, and she still has a long way to go. However, with the help of SPBD, Sera has already achieved her goal of being able to put her children through school.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>825</funded_amount><paid_amount>825</paid_amount><image><id>16582</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Textiles</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Purchase

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Peka operates a small grocery store where she sells foodstuffs, toiletries, etc. Peka has 3 children to support, two of which are already working and one helps her out in running the business. Compared to the time when Peka had just opened her grocery store, the financial burden has gradually lessened. Her shop is open 7 days a week, catering for the public for 15 hours straight. Peka&apos;s goal has been to improve her standard of living and to provide good education and access to proper health care for her children. With SPBD&apos;s assistance, she has achieved her goals. However, Peka continues to work hard in order to motivate not only her family, but also other less fortune and helpless unemployed women. Her good business sense and determination have made her successful, and currently Peka is able to make a weekly profit of 200 tala (USD$30). She plans to further expand her business, most probably by creating a supermarket that would offer a greater variety of goods than what she is supplying and selling now. Peka hopes to become financially independent and continue to be a great role model to the women who are unemployed and willing to improve their families&apos; living standards. In particular, Peka offers them support and help in complying with the SPBD policies.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>16587</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

She is unemployed, married, and has 6 children. Her husband does not have a permanent job, and is not able to earn enough money to support their family. Peata&apos;s biggest worry has been the school fees for her 4 children attending school and other basic needs for her family. She opted for starting the business, because cakes are cheap to make, and because the business would not much interfere with her busy schedule as a full time mother. In addition, pork cakes are a favourite among the locals, especially children. To start out, Peata bought flour and meat, and now makes about 40 buns daily, 7 days a week. She sells the cakes to school children during the week and to other village people during the weekends. Occasionally, Peata&apos;s husband delivers the cakes to nearby shops.  She earns up to  280 tala (US$90) a week, and is now able to cover the family&apos;s basic needs in addition to paying her children’s school fees. Peata is even able to save some of the money to eventually increase the amount of cakes she supplies. In addition, she still manages to make loan payments on time, so that she can move up to the next loan level. Her determination to improve her family’s standard of living is making her work harder and learn to save with the help of SPBD&apos;s savings programme.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>775</funded_amount><paid_amount>775</paid_amount><image><id>16589</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Marina is married with three children. She runs a small business selling shoes and boots for men and women in one of the busiest city markets. Marina has been self-employed for 10 years and the business is now the sole means of support for her family. Her husband actively helps her by traveling to remote wholesale centers to purchase inventory.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Marina is a determined hard-worker. She has experienced many challenges in her life. Her younger daughter had a spine fracture and was temporarily paralyzed. Fortunately, she recovered fully and is now doing well. Challenges have only strengthened Marina’s character. Her determination and strong will to succeed have helped to keep her business stable and sustainable and have promoted its expansion. Marina has received and paid back 10 different loans from “Nadiya Ukraine”. Presently, she has about $3,000 of working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to $500. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Marina would like to get a loan for $1,000 that will allow her to purchase 100 pairs of footwear for the spring season. She is planning to buy leather shoes for men and women that always sell well in the spring. Income from the sale of these shoes will be put towards some family expenses. Marina would like to invest generated profits into her eldest daughter’s hairdressing business – making her entrepreneurial dreams come true. She believes that her first priority as a mother and successful business owner is to help her daughter find her business focus, set a good strategy and see her own startup succeed. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Марина – одружена, в неї троє дітей. Вона займається бізнесом з продажу чоловічого та жіночого взуття та чобіт. Працює вона на одному з найбільших місцевих ринків. Марина займається цим бізнесом вже 10 років, торгівля є єдиним джерелом прибутку для родини. Її чоловік активно допомагає з бізнесом, їздить на оптові бази, де закупає товар за помірними цінами для подальшої роздрібної торгівлі. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Марина – наполеглива та працьовита. Вона пройшла багато випробувань. Декілька років тому її дочка отримала перелом хребта, деякий час залишалася паралізованою. На щастя, вона повністю одужала і зараз почуває себе чудово. Випробування тільки загартували характер Марини. Її наполегливість та сила волі допомогли їй зберегти стабільність бізнесу та сприяли його розвитку. Марина отримала та вчасно сплатила усі 10 позик від „Надії України”. Зараз в товар в неї вкладено приблизно 3000 доларів. Чистий місячний прибуток складає 500 доларів. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Марина хотіла б отримати позику в 1000 доларів, яка дозволить їй закупити 100 пар взуття напередодні весни. Вона планує придбати шкіряне чоловіче та жіноче взуття, яке завжди користується попитом. Марина планує витратити прибуток від продажу взуття на потреби родини. Вона хотіла б вкласти отриманий прибуток в бізнес своєї старшої доньки, яка тримає власну перукарню. Фінансова підтримка допоможе їй втілити в життя мрії доньки. Вона вважає, що найголовніше для неї, як матері та успішного підприємця – допомогти донці знайти власну нішу в бізнесі, розробити стратегію та відкрити власну справу.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>16592</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase 100 pairs of shoes for spring season</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Melitopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>46.842222 35.373056</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-02-26T07:12:37Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Marina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-15T02:28:42Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-14T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>334</amount><local_amount>334</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-28T09:25:58Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-28T09:16:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14133</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-28T09:15:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-28T09:16:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>18132</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-28T09:15:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-28T09:16:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26713</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-28T09:16:16Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-28T09:16:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36287</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>165</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-28T09:16:33Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-28T09:16:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>165</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>47348</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-03-01T03:28:42Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-28T09:16:34Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>5027</id><name>Ivan</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Ivan runs a small business, selling food products in Melitopol’s busy central market. He is married with two children. After school he was not able find a good paying job so he decided to go into business for himself. He has now been self-employed in grocery sales for 10 years and is the sole breadwinner for his family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ivan is very determined and serious about his business. These characteristics have helped him promptly repay 5 loans from “Nadiya Ukraine”. Maintaining a reasonable pricing policy and client-friendly service have always been priorities in Ivan’s work and have ensured the success of his business. Presently, he has about $2,000 of working capital and a monthly net profit of $700.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ivan is asking for a loan of $500 to increase his assortment of food products. He is hoping to use the extra financial support to stock up on more groceries, such as dairy products, mayonnaise, coffee, tea, and canned vegetables. The loan will not only be beneficial for Ivan’s business as it will promote its expansion, but it will also help him meet his household expenses and set aside some savings for future needs.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Іван – власник бізнесу з продажу товарів харчування на центральному ринку міста Мелітополь. Він – одружений, має двох дітей. Після школи Іван не міг знайти гарно оплачувану роботу. Отже, він вирішив зайнятися власним бізнесом. Іван працює в сфері продовольчих товарів вже 10 років. Його бізнес – єдине джерело прибутку для родини.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Іван – дуже цілеспрямований та серйозний. Ці якості допомогли йому вчасно сплатити усі 5 позик, які він отримав від „Надії України”. Розумна цінова політика та ввічливе обслуговування завжди були важливими в роботі Івана та забезпечили успіх його бізнесу. Зараз, в товарі в нього приблизно 2000 доларів, щомісячний прибуток складає 700 доларів.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Іван просить про позику в 500 доларів для того, щоб розширити асортимент продовольчих товарів. Він сподівається використати додаткову фінансову підтримку для того, щоб закупити більше товарів харчування, а саме, молочних продуктів, майонезу, кави, чаю та консервованих овочів. Позика не тільки сприятиме розвитку бізнесу Івана, але й допоможе йому задовольнити усі потреби його родини та заощадити кошти на інші потреби.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Yuryi is married and has two grown children. He runs a small business selling curtain fabric which is the only source of income for his family. Yuryi has been in this business for 13 years. He owns a pavilion in the local market and rents retail space in one of the local malls. His wife is actively involved, helping him with sales.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Yuryi is a very dynamic person and his experience in this field is exemplary. He first became a client of “Nadiya Ukraine” in 2002 and has promptly repaid every loan he has received. In that time his business has seen considerable growth. Yuryi has been able to open a new vending kiosk in a local mall, and hire an employee to help him with sales. Currently, his business does about $3,000 in monthly gross revenue. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Yuryi is requesting a loan of $1,200 to purchase 8 rolls of curtain fabric which cost between $50 and $500 per roll. He is able to purchase assorted types of curtain fabrics at wholesale prices for further retail sale. He is also planning to hire a second salesperson soon which will provide a stable source of income for one more family in the community. Yuryi believes that this loan will help boost his economic activity and allow him to generate more profits. It will not only help him grow his business, but will also provide better a quality of life for he, his wife, and his employees.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Юрій – одружений, в нього двоє дорослих дітей. Він займається бізнесом з продажу гардинно-тюлевих тканин, який є єдиним джерелом прибутку для його родини. Юрій займається цим бізнесом вже 13 років. Він – власник павільйону на одному з місцевих ринків, а також він орендує торгівельне приміщення в одному з місцевих універмагів. Дружина Юрія активно допомагає йому з торгівлею. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Юрій – дуже динамічна людина, його багатий досвід роботи вартий наслідування. Він став клієнтом „Надії України” в 2002 році, вчасно сплатив усі позики. Завдяки фінансовій підтримці його бізнес значно розширився. Юрій зміг орендувати приміщення в одному з місцевих універмагів, взяв на роботу ще одного реалізатора. Зараз місячний валовий прибуток Юрія складає приблизно 3000 доларів. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Юрій просить про позику в 1200 доларів для того, щоб придбати 8 рулонів гардинно-тюлевих тканин, кожен з яких коштує приблизно 50 - 500 доларів. Він хоче закупити різноманітні тканини оптом для подальшої роздрібної торгівлі. Він також планує взяти на роботу ще одного реалізатора, що забезпечить стабільний прибуток для ще однієї родини. Юрій вважає, що позика сприятиме покращенню його економічного становища та допоможе йому отримати додаткові кошти. Фінансова підтримка не тільки сприятиме росту його бізнесу, але й забезпечить кращий рівень життя для нього, його дружини та співробітників. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>16595</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home Products Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase 8 rolls of curtain fabric </use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Melitopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>46.842222 35.373056</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-03-01T02:03:40Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Yuryi</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-23T23:52:16Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>600</amount><local_amount>600</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-12T09:18:09Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-12T09:20:04Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>600</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>22584</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-12T09:19:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-12T09:20:04Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31306</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-12T09:21:15Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-12T09:20:04Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>41768</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-12T09:20:04Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-12T09:20:04Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>53551</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-03-10T00:52:16Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-09-12T09:20:04Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>5030</id><name>Nina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Nina is married with a grown son. She supports the essential needs of her household by running a small business selling tea and coffee in a busy city market. Currently, Nina has over $3,000 of working capital in her business and her monthly net profit amounts to $1,000.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nina is very patient and polite. Her commitment to good business and her natural friendliness attract many potential clients. A variety of quality teas and coffees also makes her kiosk a popular stop for passing customers. Not long ago Nina faced big challenges due to the reconstruction of the local market where she had a kiosk. However, these difficulties didn’t stop her. On the contrary, Nina continued to work hard investing her time and efforts in the growth of her business. Today she owns two kiosks and her business is continuously expanding.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nina is requesting a loan of $1,200 to help open a new kiosk in the market and to allow her to purchase additional tea and coffee from wholesalers where she can get a good price. This loan will help to significantly boost Nina’s revenue and grow her business, further improving the quality of life for her and her family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ніна – одружена, в неї дорослий син. Забезпечувати основні потреби родини їй допомагає власний бізнес з продажу чаю та кави. Ніна працює на одному з місцевих ринків. Зараз загальна сума в товарі у неї складає більше 3000 доларів. Розмір чистого прибутку досягає 1000 доларів.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ніна – дуже терпляча та ввічлива. Її відданість власній справі та природна привітність приваблюють багато потенційних покупців. Розмаїття якісного чаю та кави притягують увагу перехожих на ринку. Нещодавно Ніна стикнулася з певними труднощами, пов’язаними з реконструкцією місцевого ринку, де був розташований її кіоск. Однак, ці випробування не зупинили її. Навпаки, Ніна продовжувала наполегливо працювати, вкладаючи час та гроші в розвиток власного бізнесу. Зараз вона володіє двома кіосками, її бізнес поступово зростає. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ніна просить про позику в 1200 доларів для того, щоб відкрити новий кіоск на ринку. Вона планує закупити додаткову партію чаю та кави оптом за помірними цінами. Позика значно підвищить прибутки Ніни та сприятиме подальшому розвитку її бізнесу, що, в свою чергу, якісно покращить життя її родини.     &#13;&#10;

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Jane Wangari, aged 50 years, is recently widowed, having lost her husband in January 2007. She has two children and two grand-children, who all depend on her, because her children are only able to get casual jobs once in a while. Jane sells cooked foods, within the Kiambiu slums, including beans, black beans and githeri, a mixture of maize and beans boiled together.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane previously had an embroidery business which collapsed after one of her sons was involved in a road accident, where she spent all she had including business money on his medical expenses. This son eventually died, leaving Jane and her other children absolutely poor. Jane had previously borrowed some money from one of the big Micro-finance institutions in Kenya, to enable her to run this business. Due to the medical problem in the family, she was unable to continue with the loan repayments, hence could not borrow again, since she was now viewed as a risky client.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane started off her current business in early 2006, after she borrowed a tin of beans from a businessman, who allowed her to cook and sell the beans, then later make the payments for the borrowed tin of beans.  From the same proceeds, she managed to buy her first tin of beans, which she continued to cook, hence setting up the business. Jane is now a member of the Vumilia group of Action Now Kenya, in the Kiambiu slums, where she has so far accessed two levels of loans, of Usd. 57 and Usd. 85, both of which she used to increase her stock, and which she has since repaid successfully. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Currently Jane has only one sufuria (cooking pot) of her own, while the other two she has are borrowed, and the owner has actually been asking her to return them. Jane therefore seeks to buy two sufurias of a bigger size than what she is currently using, together with two jikos (cooking stoves) big enough for the pots she will buy. The biggest benefit to Jane will be that she will be able to return the borrowed pots, and also acquire bigger pots that will enable her to make more food, as is required by her customers. She also intends to introduce the sale of boiled green maize (corn) and green grams, which her customers have been requesting her to make.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As part of goodwill, Jane reserves the bean stock she gets from the boiled beans and githeri, to give to some of the women within the Kiambiu slums, who are too poor to buy food. They use this stock to make a stew for the family meal, hence their children don’t have to sleep hungry as long as Jane is there. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;A loan of $75 which will be given to her in kind (i.e ANK will purchase the two pots and cooking stoves for her), will assist her not only to achieve her objective of preparing more food, but will also enable her to have more stock to serve to more people in need. The repayment period for this loan will be between 4 – 8 months.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>75</funded_amount><paid_amount>75</paid_amount><image><id>16784</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase 2 sufurias (cooking pots) and 2 jikos (inexpensive cooking stoves)</use><location><country_code>KE</country_code><country>Kenya</country><town>Kiambiu Slums, Nairobi</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>1 38</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>36</partner_id><posted_date>2007-02-24T01:25:50Z</posted_date><loan_amount>75</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Jane</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-03-10T01:49:13Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>75</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>75</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>18.75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>18.75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>18.75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>18.75</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>18.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>18.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>18.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>18.75</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>15</amount><local_amount>15</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-11T07:25:42Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-06T09:24:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>15</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>12755</payment_id><comment>Jane is extremely excited to make her first repayment for the loan she received.
