With a new loan, she will be able to buy more and invest her capital. The extra money will help her look after her children at home, especially with the school fees for their education. Her future goal is to buy a plot in Bulenga, a Kampala suburb (within the city limits) and build a house.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Teo has successfully paid back more than five

She is 32 years old, married, and has three children, ages 6, 4, and 2. For the past four years she has been selling charcoal, thanks to an initial loan from MCDT. She buys sacks of charcoal from villagers for 18,000/= (Ugandan shillings, about $10 US) and sells it in much smaller amounts, starting at 500/= (about 30 cents). Ultimately, she makes a profit of about 7,000/= per sack (about $4).  &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;She rents a stand in Kibuye where she sells her charcoal. Sometimes it is difficult because people ask for charcoal on credit and don’t pay her back, or people try to con her or steal her things.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;With a new loan, she would like to start another retail business selling items used daily in the home, such as salt, sugar, rice, and cooking oil. With this expanded inventory, she will be able to earn a regular income. Her ultimate goal is to construct a house in the Wakiso district.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Pamela has successfully paid back more than five loans.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1175</funded_amount><paid_amount>1175</paid_amount><image><id>164058</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Charcoal Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To open a shop selling essential commodities</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Kampala</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.315556 32.565556</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>112</partner_id><posted_date>2008-06-02T15:20:14Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1175</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Pamela</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Cissy</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Aidah</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Fatina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-23T19:01:45Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>UGX</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1900000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1175</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>316666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>316666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>316666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>316666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>316666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>316666.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>195.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>195.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>195.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>195.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>195.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>195.85</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>196</amount><local_amount>316936.17</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T01:17:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>318304</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>275468</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>196</amount><local_amount>316936.17</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T01:18:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>318304</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>305023</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>196</amount><local_amount>316936.17</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-24T07:33:59Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>318304</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>335981</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>196</amount><local_amount>316936.17</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-28T07:50:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>318304</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>369814</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Micro Credit Development Trust SACCO (MCDT) -

As his business stabilizes and grows Ikrom hopes that it will cover the mounting expenses he will face as his dearest children grow up.&lt;p&gt; Ikrom is asking for a loan of 990 $ US dollars over a term of 7 months. Ikrom would use the loan to buy seeds and fertilizer, and also to buy livestock and pay the salaries of seasonal workers. Ikrom thanks everyone for their support and promises to repay the loan fully and on time.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>164063</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

He is married with seven children. He is a supplier and retailer of local meat like beef, goat meat, mutton and pork to food vendors and local restaurant operators.&lt;p&gt; He buys his supplies from villages and sells to his customers. With his small working capital, he is not able to buy larger quantities to make enough income. &lt;p&gt;He wants to use the loan to buy bulk beef, goat meat, mutton and pork to serve his customers good quality meat for their meals. He believes this will provide him with increased income to expand his business and also finance his children’s education. &lt;p&gt;He belongs to the community group called Decency Trust Group. In this group, members guarantee one another as social collateral to access loans and peer pressure to repay the

Two sons are currently working in Russia, and their wives live with Sharofat. To keep her youngest son from being drafted into the army, she sent him and her husband to live in Kyrgystan. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sharofat and her daughters-in-law have not had it easy. They have cows and used to sell milk and milk products, but now each daughter-in-law has small children who also need the milk. Raising and selling livestock is the only business in the town. Sharofat gradually sold the sheep she had, but it’s clear that selling them now means that later there will be nothing to live on. Her sons are little by little sending small amounts of money, always setting aside a certain amount to send to her son and husband in Kyrgystan to keep her son out of the army. Neighbors encouraged her to contact Microinvest and develop a livestock business. She and her daughters-in-law plan to use the remaining money to buy wool  for knitting rugs to sell (they have prior experience with this). She plans to acquire more livestock, so that after 3 months she can sell at a higher price.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Шарофат 57 лет, она замужем имеет 3 сыновей. Сейчас двое сына находятся в России на заработке их жены живут с Шарофат. А младшего сына она с мужем отправила в  Киргизистан, так как  его могут забрать в армию. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Шарофат и ее невестам приходилось не легко, у них ест коровы , раньше они продавали молоко и молочные изделия, сейчас когда у каждой невестки есть маленькие дети, они тоже нуждаются в молоке. А  откорм и  продажа скота является единственным бизнесом в селе. Шарофат по немного продавала имеющиеся овец, но теперь она поняла, что если продаст, то дальше будет не на что жить. Сыновья по мало присылают не большую сумму, откладывая необходимую сумму  денег отправляла в Киргизию сыну и мужу, что бы удержать сына от армии.&#13;&#10;Соседи  посоветовали обратиться в Микроинвест, что бы развить бизнес скота, а на оставшийся деньги она и ее невесты планируют покупать шерсть, вязать ковры и продавать (они этим раньше занимались).  Она планирует приобрести еще скот, что бы через 3 месяца продать подороже.

groups of enterprising women who create a village bank through which they receive assistance in terms of loans. The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities which enable them to live in dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women the energy and motivation to reach success.&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In a remote area of Carapegua called Quiindy, a group of women heard about The Committee of Entrepreneuring Women. They set up a meeting and shared their desire of changing their world for the better by working very hard. These hopeful words stimulated optimism among these women and they decided to form a Committee.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Among the businesses these women run are grocery stores and sales of chipas and crafts. Some of these women are weavers. They need the credit to buy the materials related to their businesses; for instance, threads, fabrics, crafts, and ingredients to prepare chipas and others. &lt;p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1875</funded_amount><paid_amount>1875</paid_amount><image><id>164111</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Purchase of threads, fabrics, crafts, ingredients to prepare chipas and others. &lt;p&gt;</use><location><country_code>PY</country_code><country>Paraguay</country><town>Carapegua</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-25.8 -57.233333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>58</partner_id><posted_date>2008-06-04T20:00:13Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1875</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Marcelina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Leandra</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Daniela</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Teresa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Maria</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Francisca</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Mirian</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Cecilia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Liz</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Margarita</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Estela</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Casimira</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Toribia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Encarnación</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Tomasa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-19T09:52:04Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PYG</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>7500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1875</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-19T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2500000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-19T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2500000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-19T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2500000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>625</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>625</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>625</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>625</amount><local_amount>2500000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-05T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T05:18:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2512500</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>257899</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>625</amount><local_amount>2500000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-05T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T05:31:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2512500</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>286628</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>625</amount><local_amount>2500000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-05T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-09T01:59:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2512500</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>316843</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-06-05T09:52:04Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-09-09T01:59:54Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>50183</id><name>Shahnaz&apos;s Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Shahnaz is 36 years and is married to M.S., who is a milkman by profession.

groups of enterprising women who create a village bank through which they receive assistance in terms of loans. The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities which enable them to live in dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women the energy and motivation to reach success.&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In a remote neighborhood located in Carepegua, a group of 20 women heard about the the Committee of Entrepreneuring Women and its profitable results. They decided to set up a meeting to know more about the program and without hesitation they formed a committee. They wanted to lift themselves out of poverty and to bring benefits to their own families. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Some of these women are door-to-door sales people. Some are craftswomen, others are teachers and the rest are weavers. They need the money to invest in the purchase of threads, fabrics, and sheets, among other things.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1500</funded_amount><paid_amount>1500</paid_amount><image><id>164115</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To

Alicio is studying farming administration at the university. Next year he will be done with college and he will make his dream come true. He always wanted to have a degree. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Hamacas (hammocks) are a type of swing very typical in Paraguay. Usually people take a siesta (nap) on the hamacas (swing). Since it is a tradition, there is always a huge demand for hamacas (swings).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;From an early age Alicio started working with his mother in the production of swings and bedspreads. They started selling their products to different craft stores, but then they realized that they could sell on their own, and that would be much more profitable. Alicio is responsible for distributing the swings and bedspreads. Thanks to the increase in income, Alicio bought a car to make the distribution faster and more efficient. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Alicio needs the credit in order to buy more raw materials such as threads, fabrics and others.

Selling rice and beans in a private primary school in her neighborhood, she brings in an average of 15,000 francs (about US$ 36) a day. She would like to sell more rice and beans, sauces and pastas. Since the enrollment of the school has grown and a great many students spend their afternoons at school where there is still no cafeteria, she would like to expand her business. She is therefore requesting this loan so that she can better serve her customers. &lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer&lt;P&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Née le 26 novembre 1979 à COTONOU, dame F. Yvette est mariée et mère de 4 enfants tous encore à sa charge. Vendeuse de riz et du haricot dans une école primaire privée de son  quartier, elle réalise un chiffre d’affaire total de 15 000 francs en moyenne par jour. Elle souhaite vendre en plus du riz et du haricot, de la sauce et de la pâte. En raison de l’augmentation de l’effectif de cette école et du nombre impressionnant d’élèves qui passe leur après midi dans l’école qui ne dispose pas encore d’une de restauration, elle voudrait élargir son activité. Elle sollicite donc ce crédit pour mieux servir ses clients.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>164135</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Catering</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase

groups of enterprising women who create a village bank through which they receive assistance in terms of loans. The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities which enable them to live in dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women the energy and motivation to reach success.&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In a remote neighborhood located in Carepegua, a group of 15 women heard about the the Committee of Entrepreneuring Women and its profitable results. They decided to set up a meeting to know more about the program and, without hesitation, they formed a committee. They wanted to lift themselves out of poverty and to bring benefits to their own families. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Some of these women are craftswomen, others are salespeople, and the rest are weavers. They need the money to invest in the purchase of threads, fabrics, and sheets, among others. &lt;p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1550</funded_amount><paid_amount>1550</paid_amount><image><id>164138</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Purchase threads, fabrics, and sheets, among others. &lt;p&gt;</use><location><country_code>PY</country_code><country>Paraguay</country><town>Carapegua</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-25.8 -57.233333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>58</partner_id><posted_date>2008-06-11T01:44:36Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1550</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Rosa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Patricia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>María</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Lucrecia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Juana</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Elisa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Dolores</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Estela</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Rosa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Sonia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Blanca</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Justina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Esmilce</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Juliana</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Julia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-25T16:00:43Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PYG</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>6200000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1550</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2066666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2066666.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>2066666.66</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>516.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>516.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>516.66</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>517</amount><local_amount>2068000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-13T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T05:18:48Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2078340</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>265887</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>517</amount><local_amount>2068000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-13T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T05:31:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2078340</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>294874</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>516</amount><local_amount>2064000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-13T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-14T07:23:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>2074320</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>325497</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-06-11T16:00:43Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-09-14T07:23:40Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>50197</id><name>María Graciela</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Maria Graciela V.

successfully repaid seven loans.  The association is part of the Juan Pablo II Center located in the Ferropetol Zone in El Alto City.  They are 16 female members, which have proven to be very organized on their activities and responsible with their payments. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They are different businesses within the association for example; there is a meat market; one that makes and sells tents for cars; but the main activity is handcrafting metals.  They make their art in shops located on their own homes, unfortunately they sell only on demand because they don’t have a place to show them to the public.  This year they have their hopes set on showing their creations on the “Annual Craft and Micro-Entrepreneur Fair in La Paz” (FIPAZ), where they will be able to meet local and international customers. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They request a loan to be able to have capital to purchase new raw material and complete higher quality crafts.  This would increase their income and they could improve the quality of life for their families.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Christian Jimenez, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La asociación denominada “Pacajes” pertenece a la familia de  Pro-Mujer hace ya tres años cumpliendo con su séptimo ciclo de crédito. La mencionada asociación  pertenece al centro focal de Juan Pablo II ubicada  en la zona Ferropetrol  de la ciudad de El Alto, a la fecha  cuenta con 16 socias que han demostrado ser un grupo organizado en cuanto a sus cuotas de crédito y actividades internas.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Existen diferentes negocios  dentro la asociación como ser; la venta de carne vacuna, confección y venta de carpas para automóviles y otros, pero la actividad principal es  Hojalatería  (artesanía en hojalata ), obras que la realizan es sus talleres ubicados en sus propias casas y los venden únicamente a pedido, ya que no cuentan con un lugar para exponerlos, Este año tienen la esperanza de poder exhibir sus trabajos en la Feria anual de Artesanía Y Microempresa de la Ciudad de La Paz (FIPAZ) donde podrían encontrar mayores contactos de venta, incluso a nivel internacional. &lt;p&gt;Por eso solicitan mayores créditos con el fin de reforzar su capital para realizar obras de mejor calidad, con esto mejorarían sus ingresos, con el unico de objetivo de mejorar  el estilo de vida de sus familias.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>4050</funded_amount><paid_amount>4050</paid_amount><image><id>164156</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Crafts</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>They

Furthermore, they have to pay interest on loans that they received from Pro-Mujer to set up their businesses.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The businesses are diverse: making and selling lunches, for example, or making and selling blankets and &quot;polleras&quot; (a kind of skirt, traditionally worn in La Paz), but the sale of sports clothes is the main business.  They generally take their products to La Paz&apos;s &quot;Mananeras&quot; market, so called because sales are only allowed until 10 in the morning (&quot;manana&quot;).

cloth, robes and dresses), the Dieuf Diarignou group plans to invest in an innovative business opportunity: the preparation and sale of Cafe Touba.  Cafe Touba is a traditional drink particular to Senegal, in which roasted coffee beans are brewed with whole cloves.  The loan will allow the group to purchase the utensils, stoves and sachets needed to prepare the dry Cafe Touba mix and package it for retail sale in the markets of nearby towns as well as throughout their own village.  This will help to create jobs and allow the women to participate more actively in the economic life of their country, and the extra income will provide more working capital for their clothing sales business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Longtemps axé dans le petit commerce (commerce de tissus, robes, pagnes), le groupement Dieuf Diarignou 1 innove avec la  fabrication du café touba (une spécialité bien sénégalaise faite à base de café mélangé à des haricots torréfiés et des clous de girofle) et de sa commercialisation. Le prêt va leur permettre d&apos;acheter des matières premières (ustensiles, fours, sachets ) pour pouvoir transformer le café, le mettre dans des sachets et le vendre dans les marchés hebdomadaires et même encore dans les points les plus reculés du village afin de créer des emplois et d&apos;activer fortement la participation effective des femmes à la vie économique de leur pays, mais aussi d&apos;augmenter les revenus des membres par le profit tiré de la fabrication du café et redynamiser ses activités liées au textile.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1700</funded_amount><paid_amount>1700</paid_amount><image><id>164163</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cafe</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Preparation

The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities which enable them to live in dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these women the energy and motivation to achieve their dreams.&lt;p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2475</funded_amount><paid_amount>2475</paid_amount><image><id>164187</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>The

The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities which enable them to live in dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these women the energy and motivation to reach success.&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The committee is now very proud to be in their fourth loan cycle with 17 members. They all get along very well, pay punctually and receive the required assistance in their meetings. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Among the businesses these ladies run are: grocery stores, production of cleaning products, sales of clothing, food, drinks, bijouterie (trinkets and ornaments) and lingerie. For instance, Lizza and Carolina P. make products such as deodorants and detergents and then sell them to residents of the neighborhood.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The money provided by Kiva lenders will be used to purchase lingerie, drinks, food and raw materials to make cleaning products and clothing among others.

They all have one thing in common: the dream of becoming successful entrepreneurs in order to bring benefits to their sons.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Among the businesses these ladies run are: grocery stores, sales of fruits, remedies, furniture, coal and vegetables. The money provided by this Kiva loan will be used to purchase merchandise in some cases and raw materials in others.&lt;p&gt;  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Maria Angelica V.&apos;s &quot;Women Working Together&quot; group was formed under  the &quot;Committee of Entrepreneuring Women&quot; program carried out by Fundación Paraguaya. The programtargets groups of enterprising women who create a village bank through which they receive assistance in terms of loans. The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities which enable them to live in dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these women the energy and motivation to achieve success.&lt;p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1975</funded_amount><paid_amount>1975</paid_amount><image><id>164224</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>The

The loans that she has received have been used to buy materials, like molds, brushes, boxes and ingredients.

Tuvo éxito en sus ventas.&#13;&#10;Los préstamos que ella ha recibido los ha utilizado para la compra de sus materiales, como moldes, pinceles, cajas o ingredientes.

This is 43 year-old Rukia R., who is single and has three children aged 7, 15, and 18. She has one other dependent who lives with her because she is an orphan. In 2005, Rukia established her small general store. Working seven days a week, 13 to 16 hours a day, assisted by one employee, she earns about $100 every month from this business.  Rukia now requires a loan to purchase additional stocks of soda, water, cooking oil, and candy. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $65. In the future, Rukia plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>164360</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

This is 54-year-old Neema M., who is married and has six children between the ages of 15 and 30. She has two dependents.  In 2002, Neema established her poultry business and now requires a loan in order to purchase additional chicks in bulk as well as feed and preventative medicines. She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku, the Swahili word for ‘chickens.’ Raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I’m sure there are hundreds of other reasons raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>164361</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Poultry</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To purchase additional chicks, feed, and antibiotics.</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-05-26T17:10:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Neema</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-09T21:16:25Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>300000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-09T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-10T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:38:42Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>64955</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>263340</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-10T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:42:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>64955</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>292253</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-10T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-22T07:13:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>64955</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>322707</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-10T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-19T07:19:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>64955</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>355056</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-09T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T03:23:48Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>64955</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347654</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-05-26T21:16:25Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-12-17T03:23:48Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>50254</id><name>Debora</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Mbeya, Tanzania!

Hajra has been joined in her loan group by a few more members: Mumtaz wants to buy spare parts for her machines; Mumtaz wants a loan to buy cloth for selling; Naila wants a loan to expand her repairing business; Parveen wants a loan to expand her card business.  This is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her business. The members mutually guarantee one another&apos;s loans.

This is 29 year-old Joyce K., who is married and has four children aged between 1 and 9. In 2007, Joyce established her poultry business. Working seven days a week, 9 to 12 hours a day, she earns about $110 every month from this business. Joyce now requires a loan to purchase additional chicks, feed, and antibiotics, and she hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $43. In the future, Joyce plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about ‘kuku,’ the Swahili word for ‘chickens.’ Raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I’m sure there are hundreds of other reasons that raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>164374</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Poultry</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

This is 25-year-old Mwanahawa M., who is married and has two children, one aged three and one four months. She also has one other dependent living with her because he attends school in town. In 2007, Mwanahawa established her video show business. Assisted by her one employee, working seven days a week, five to eight hours a day, she earns about $130 every month.  &lt;p&gt;Mwanahawa now requires a loan in order to expand the range of videos which she shows for an entrance fee. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $43. In the future, Mwanahawa plans to open another business. She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>164378</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Entertainment</activity><sector>Entertainment</sector><use>To expand the range of videos and DVDs which she shows at selected times for a small entrance fee.</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-05-27T19:40:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Mwanahawa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-11T03:38:35Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>400000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>80000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>80000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>80000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-10T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>80000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-10T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>80000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>70</amount><local_amount>80000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:38:47Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>82670</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>264339</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>70</amount><local_amount>80000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:42:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>82670</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>293261</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>70</amount><local_amount>80000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-11T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-22T07:14:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>82670</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>323762</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>70</amount><local_amount>80000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-11T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-19T07:20:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>82670</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>356175</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>70</amount><local_amount>80000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-10T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T03:23:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>82670</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347662</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-05-28T03:38:35Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-12-17T03:23:56Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>50264</id><name>Sarwar&apos;s Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Sarwar is 36 years old and is married to T.

I’m sure there are hundreds of other reasons that raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>164383</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Poultry</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Many people who hear about microfinance (or kiva.org) for the first time ask anxiously, “How do you make sure people pay back? Won’t they just take the money?”  Firstly, most MFIs have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. More important than any of these deterrents, however, is the incentive clients have to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another… The incentive to have on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded is a powerful one.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>164390</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

She has now applied for a loan of $925 to diversify her grocery shop into a store and keep the products like rice, cooking oil and sugar.   &#13;&#10;She has been joined in her loan group by a few more members:  Asia wants a loan to buy a grinding machine; Naseem wants a loan to buy seasonal fruit; and Sakina and Seema want loans to buy auto-rickshaws on installments. &#13;&#10;This is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another&apos;s loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;(Seema Baji on the above picture was not present that time)</en></texts></description><status>deleted</status><funded_amount>925</funded_amount><image><id>164391</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Services</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To expand their businesses</use><location><country_code>PK</country_code><country>Pakistan</country><town>Kasur</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>31.115556 74.446667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>60</partner_id><loan_amount>925</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Balquis</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Asia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Naseem</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Sakina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Seema</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_amount>62000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>925</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments/><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>50271</id><name>Jenipher</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Mbeya, Tanzania!

She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is ‘restaurant’ or ‘café’, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or café in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don’t even appear in the Lonely Planet’s budget guide, but if you’re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>164399</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cafe</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase additional ingredients such as rice, maize, and beans in bulk.</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbeya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.9 33.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-05-25T17:10:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Mwajabu</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-08T18:38:30Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>300000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-08T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-08T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>60000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>55</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:38:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>65615</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>261148</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:42:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>65615</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>290046</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-22T07:13:28Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>65615</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>320403</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-08T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-18T07:20:41Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>65615</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>352650</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>55</amount><local_amount>60000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-08T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T03:24:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>65615</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347671</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-05-25T18:38:30Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-12-17T03:24:02Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>50275</id><name>Subi</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Mbeya, Tanzania!

This is 44-year-old Rita M..  She is single and has two children aged 16 and 25. She also has two other dependents, who live with her because they are orphans.  In 2005, Rita opened a general store. Working six days a week, and more than 16 hours a day, she earns about $870 a month. Fortunately, she receives help from her sister and two employees. Rita has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and has applied for a new loan to buy additional stocks of soft drinks and foodstuffs. She hopes that this loan will allow her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $210. In the future, Rita plans to increase the quantity and range of items she has for sale. She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.&lt;P&gt;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.

She has already received and successfully repaid three loans from SELFINA, and has applied a new loan  to expand the range of clothing and cloth she has for sale, and to buy additional stocks of rice, beans, and maize in bulk. She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.&lt;P&gt;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.&lt;P&gt;SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

This is 29-year-old Victoria N..  She is married and has a six-month-old child. In 2004, Victoria established a business that sells crops wholesale. Working five days a week, and five to eight hours a day, she earns about $130 a month. She also has three employees, and her husband helps her run the company. Victoria has already received and repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now has applied a new loan to buy additional stocks of rice, beans, and maize in bulk. She hopes that this loan will allow her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $90. In the future, Victoria plans to increase the quantity and range of items she has for sale.

This is 30-year-old Eva M..  She is married and has five children aged from 7 to 16. She has two other dependents who live with her because their parents died of HIV/AIDS.  In 2000, Eva established a business selling timber. Working six days a week, and nine to 12 hours a day, she earns about $780 every month from this business. Her husband and one employee help her run this business.  Eva needs a loan in order to buy additional stocks of wood in bulk. She hopes that this loan will allow her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $40. In the future, Eva plans to increase the quantity and range of the items she has for sale. She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.&lt;P&gt;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generations, because of their low cost and the general appeal of anything western or modern. &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Some argue that the popularity of cast-offs from the West is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress, however the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>164446</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used Clothing</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To purchase additional stocks of rice and used clothing</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbarali</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.433333 34.183333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-05-26T18:50:16Z</posted_date><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Eva</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-22T21:54:01Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>42.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>42.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>42.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>42.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>42.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>42.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>42.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>42.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>42.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>42.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>43</amount><local_amount>50588.24</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:40:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>51299</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>275296</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>43</amount><local_amount>50588.24</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:43:10Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>51299</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>304830</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>43</amount><local_amount>50588.24</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-24T07:41:57Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>51299</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>335767</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>41</amount><local_amount>48235.29</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-11-16T08:54:59Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>48913</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>369966</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Sero Lease and Finance Ltd.

This is 34 year-old Dativa G..  She is married, and has six children between the ages of 3 and 13. In 1999, Dativa opened her liquor store. Dativa has already received and successfully repaid two loans from SELFINA, and has applied for this loan in order to purchase additional stocks of beer and soda in bulk. She thanks you for your support. &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;This client is a perfect example of why microfinance works and why a large majority of clients repay their loans. A lot of people who hear about microfinance (or kiva.org) for the first time ask anxiously, “but how do you make sure people pay the loan back? Won’t they just take the money?” The implication is that the clientele who access microfinance (usually the ‘poor’) are less trustworthy, efficient or educated than ‘ordinary’ people. Whether or not this is true is irrelevant for a number of reasons. Firstly, most microfinance lenders have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. More important than any of these deterrents, however, is an incentive: the incentive clients have to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another…The primary incentive is to have on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>164451</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Liquor Store / Off-License</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase additional stocks of beer and soft drinks in bulk</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbarali</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.433333 34.183333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-05-28T11:30:09Z</posted_date><loan_amount>850</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Dativa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-19T01:17:10Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>850</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-18T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:39:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>202810</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>271835</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:43:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>202810</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>301087</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-19T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-23T07:23:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>202810</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>331821</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-19T09:00:03Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-24T07:09:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>202810</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>365900</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-18T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T03:24:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>202810</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347696</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-06-05T01:17:10Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-12-17T03:24:22Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>50304</id><name>Sarah</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania!

Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of ‘bar’ selling Coke, Fanta, and Guiness. (Pepsi has made it to most African capitals but not to the sticks, although I’m sure they’re working on it!) The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing; a very cheap marketing tool. All of which explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture, whether you’re the CEO of Coca Cola Ltd. in the United States or a micro-entrepreneur in Tanzania!</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>164454</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase additional stocks of water, soda, juice, cooking oil, soap, and sugar in bulk</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbarali</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.433333 34.183333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-05-28T22:10:09Z</posted_date><loan_amount>850</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Sarah</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-23T19:13:04Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>850</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>85</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:40:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>101405</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>275297</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>85</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:43:10Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>101405</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>304831</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>85</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-24T07:41:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>101405</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>335768</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>85</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-11-16T08:55:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>101405</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>369967</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Sero Lease and Finance Ltd.

She thanks you for your support.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. For example, when a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment – a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.&#13;&#10;This is a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets. They are, therefore, labelled ‘not-creditworthy’ by financial institutions because they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services, for women with low

For example, when a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment – a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.&#13;&#10;This is a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets. They are, therefore, labelled ‘not-creditworthy’ by financial institutions because they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services, for women with low incomes.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>164459</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To purchase additional stocks of clothing and rice in bulk</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbarali</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.433333 34.183333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-05-29T15:00:11Z</posted_date><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Habiba</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-12T20:15:01Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>700000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-12T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>140000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-12T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>140000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-12T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>140000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-12T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>140000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-12T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>140000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>120</amount><local_amount>140000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-12T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:38:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>143160</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>265367</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>120</amount><local_amount>140000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-12T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:42:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>143160</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>294323</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>120</amount><local_amount>140000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-12T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-22T07:14:11Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>143160</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>324853</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>120</amount><local_amount>140000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-12T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:18:11Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>143160</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>357336</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>120</amount><local_amount>140000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-12T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T03:24:28Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>143160</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347699</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-05-29T20:15:01Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-12-17T03:24:28Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>50307</id><name>Amina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania!

She thanks you for your support. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. This serves as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

This serves as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from the said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment – a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>164741</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase additional stocks of rice in bulk.</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbarali</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.433333 34.183333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-05-31T02:30:14Z</posted_date><loan_amount>850</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Magleth</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-17T01:33:53Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>850</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>170</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-17T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:39:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>201713.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>269849</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-17T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:42:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>201713.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>298992</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-17T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-22T07:14:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>201713.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>329598</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-17T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-22T07:18:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>201713.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>363626</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>200000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T03:24:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>201713.5</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347713</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-06-03T01:33:53Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-12-17T03:24:49Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>50341</id><name>Oliver</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mambo from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania!

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.&lt;P&gt;SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment – a process called a sale and leaseback

This is 35 year-old Aginesi N..  She is married and has four children between the ages of 5 and 18. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;In 2006, Aginesi established her crop wholesaling business. Aginesi needs a loan to buy rice in bulk. She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.&lt;P&gt;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.&lt;P&gt;SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment – a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>164778</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To buy rice in bulk.</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Mbarali</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-8.433333 34.183333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-05-26T18:50:20Z</posted_date><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Aginesi</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-12T03:03:36Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-11T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-11T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>85</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>85</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-12T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:38:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100856.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>265369</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>85</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-12T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:42:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100856.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>294325</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>85</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-12T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-22T07:14:11Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100856.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>324855</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>85</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-12T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-21T07:18:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100856.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>357338</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>85</amount><local_amount>100000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-11T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-12-17T03:25:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100856.75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5347733</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-05-29T03:03:36Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-12-17T03:25:33Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>50364</id><name>Emmanuel</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Emmanuel is married and he has two children.

This is 33 year-old Eliza M.. She is married and has three children, ages 3, 7, and 13. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;In 1990, Eliza established her butcher shop. Eliza needs a loan to buy a motorcycle, which she will use to pick up supplies and make deliveries to customers. She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.&lt;P&gt;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.&lt;P&gt;SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment – a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1025</funded_amount><paid_amount>1025</paid_amount><image><id>164788</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Butcher Shop</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase a motorbike, which she will use to pick up supplies and make deliveries to customers.</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Kyela</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-9.583333 33.85</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>90</partner_id><posted_date>2008-05-26T21:30:11Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1025</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Eliza</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-23T17:17:04Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>TZS</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1025</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>120000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>102.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>102.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>102.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>102.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>102.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>102.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>102.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>102.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>102.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>102.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>103</amount><local_amount>120585.37</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:40:10Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>122214.65</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>275299</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>103</amount><local_amount>120585.37</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T00:43:11Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>122214.65</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>304833</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>103</amount><local_amount>120585.37</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-24T07:41:59Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>122214.65</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>335770</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>101</amount><local_amount>118243.9</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-11-16T08:55:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>119841.55</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>369969</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Sero Lease and Finance Ltd.

She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;It is said that Coca Cola® is one of the most recognized symbols or ‘words’ in the world. And it’s true. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of ‘bar’ selling Coke, Fanta, and Guiness (Pepsi has made it to most African capitals but not to the sticks, but I’m sure they’re working on it!).

This is 39 year-old Naomi M.. She is married and has two children aged 13 and 22. In 2005, Naomi established her general store and salon business.

She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately US $50. In the future, Naomi plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment – a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>175</funded_amount><paid_amount>175</paid_amount><image><id>164820</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Beauty

They hope to be able to afford to send their children to school as their income becomes more stable. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Rice farming is a crucial profession in Cambodia. However, many farmers are selling their land and giving up traditional farming as big business pours into Cambodia looking for land to develop. As a result, rice crops are becoming smaller and smaller, causing a food shortage in the region. Thus, Srey P.’s profession is a crucial one. &lt;/P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;She wants to dig a large basin by her field that she can use to store water for irrigation.

In his farming operation, he grows rice, wheat, peas, and pods, and he has been cultivating the land as such for the past four years. Each year, Akram grows a sufficient amount of crops for his family&apos;s consumption needs and to sell crops for a profit as well. In fact, by generating a stable income from this business, Akram is able to support his parents. Akram’s mother, who is pictured in the photo, helps him to sell his crop yield. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;This year is especially important for Akram as he is going to marry his chosen one. With this purpose in mind, he is seeking to increase his business in order to make enough money to pay for his marriage. Thus, today he requests a loan in the amount of 3,000 Somoni ($875), to be repaid within 7 months, in order to purchase seeds and mineral fertilizer. Akram thanks everyone for supporting him, and he promises to be punctual with his loan payments.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>875</funded_amount><paid_amount>875</paid_amount><image><id>164960</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Zarnigor is a shop vendor, and has operated her own small business for 4 years already. She rents the shop in the local market, where she sells personal hygiene products such as detergents, soaps, toothpastes, razors, and deodorants, as well as different kinds of toys for kids and other such items. On a typical day, she works from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. Because Zarnigor is very friendly and polite, she has developed an extremely loyal client base. &#13;&#10;She dreams of expanding her business and of opening up her own store. To that end, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 1,400 Somoni ($425) to purchase more goods to sell and to thereby increase the variety of products for her customers&apos; benefit. Zarnigor promises to repay the loan within 9 months, and thanks everybody for their support.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>164964</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

She is married with five children. Her husband is a taxi driver. In order to help her husband support their family, Fotima runs her own business. &lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;In particular, Fotima has been running a catering business for 25 years, whereby she provides the meals of the national cuisine. She operates her business with the help of her daughter in the central local market, which allows Fotima to have many clients, the majority of whom make purchases in the market and stop by her business to enjoy her delicacies. On a daily basis, Fotima purchases the latest foodstuffs and she then cooks delicious dishes for her customers. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Over the last 25 years, her business has generated stable income, but this year is especially important for Fotima because one of her sons is getting married while another son is graduating from school and will soon be entering the university. Being a loving mother, Fotima wants to support her sons and, in order to do so, she is planning to expand her business by purchasing additional kitchen wares. If she is able to put her plan into place, she expects to generate more income, which she will spend on the marriage of her oldest son and to pay the fees for the education of her younger son. With this purpose  in mind, she is requesting a loan in the amount of $850 to be repaid within 12 months. Fotima is counting on your help, and not only thanks all for supporting her but also promises to repay the loan promptly.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>164966</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Catering</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

He has two kids, both of whom are young at present, but he works extremely hard in order to ensure the best future for them. His wife takes care of their house and watches over their kids. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;For a living, Akram works as a farmer, and he has done so for six years. His business is stable and is the main source of income for his family. Specifically, Akram grows onions and maize. During the growing season, Akram works in the field from early in the morning until late at night. Five years ago, Akram started his business by producing onions on a meager 0.10 hectare plot of land, whereas now he grows onions and other vegetables on a 1.30 hectacre plot. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Today, Akram is requesting a loan in the amount of 2,000 Somoni ($600) to be repaid over 12 months so that he may purchase seeds and mineral fertilizer. In addition, any remaining loan proceeds will be used to pay the salaries of his hired seasonal workers. Akram thanks everyone for their support, and he promises to repay the loan in a timely manner.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>164973</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

In particular, he is requesting a loan in the amount of 2,000 Somoni ($600), to be repaid within 12 months, in order to buy mineral fertilizer and seeds. After gathering his yield, he wants to sell them to local inhabitants at prices that are lower than in the market. He promises to repay the loan in a timely manner. Shavkat and his hopeful wife are counting on your help, and he expresses his deep gratitude to everyone for supporting

She is married, and she and her husband have raised eight children. Almost all of their children are married and have their own children, who in turn adore their grandparents. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Adolat is a farmer. She has worked in agriculture for twenty years, and in that time she has gained a great deal of experience and a love for the land. Her younger sons, who are not married, help her with the business. In particular, Adolat grows crops such as potatoes, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots. She and her sons work from early in the morning (typically starting at 6:00 a.m.) until late in the evening (until 6:00 p.m or so). Each year Adolat grows a sufficient amount of crops for family consumption and to sell for a profit. Indeed, her business has been the main source of stable income for the family for the past five years because her husband is retired and is on a pension. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Adolat is planning to cover the higher education expenses of her youngest son because he is finishing school and will soon be entering university. As such, she is seeking a loan in the amount of 2,000 Somoni ($600) to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer for the harvest and to thereby increase the quality and quantiy of her yield. The loan will be repaid within 12 months. Your support will truly help her and will be an important driver of the growth of Adolat’s business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>164978</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

In order to support her parents over the last 10 years, she has been running her own business. In fact, her business is very successful and generates stable, significant income, thereby allowing Sabohat to improve her family&apos;s living conditions. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;More specifically, Sabohat sells fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, apricots, strawberries, and apples. She begins her workday early each day at 5:00 a.m., and she buys fruits and vegetables from local farmers and thereafter sells such produce in the market. Importantly, she sells her goods at attractive (i.e., reasonable) prices, so her business is popular amongst shoppers at the market. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Currently, she is seeking to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables in order to increase the variety of goods she sells. Consequently, she is hereby requesting 2,400 Somoni ($700) to be repaid within 12 months. Sabohat is counting on your help, and she wants to express her gratitude for everyone who supports her.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>164984</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits &amp;

She is married with four children, all of whom are in school except for her oldest son, who is in his freshman year of university. As any mother, she wants her children to have everything they need, and she dreams that all of them will be able to receive higher education. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She and her husband are both farmers. She has been working the land for six years. In fact, she began cultivating her land through her and her oldest son’s efforts, and she has gradually gotten ahead in life with such efforts. On the cultivated land, Muhabbat grows wheat, rice, and maize. When it is prime growing season, Muhabbat works in the field from early morning until late at night. She is proud to say that her business is one of her greatest accomplishments in life. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Muhabbat is planning to cover the higher education expenses of her second son because he is soon finishing school and is about to enter university. Therefore, Muhabbat is applying for a loan for the first time, seeking 2,000 Somoni ($600) over a term of 12 months. With the loan proceeds, Muhabbat is planning to purchase seeds and mineral fertilizer, and she use the remaining proceeds to pay the salaries of her hired seasonal workers. Muhabbat thanks everyone who trusted her and for their support, and she promises to pay the loan in a timely manner.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>164986</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Vazira is 44 years old. She is married with three children. Two of her children attend the university and the third one is finishing school but will soon attend the university as well. Her husband is a cook in the local restaurant. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In the picture Vazira and her friend Ibodat are trading alongside on another, that is why they have been pictured together. Vazira is standing on the left side and Ibodat is on the right.&#13;&#10;Vazira is a market vendor. She started her business ten years ago with only a few products, but her business is currently more stable. Vazira sells fruits and vegetables, such as apricots, apples, strawberries, tomatoes, cucumbers, and many others. Her sons help Vazira with the business. Vazira begins her workday early each morning at 5:00 a.m. In practice, she buys fruits and vegetables from the local farmers, and she then sells such produce in the market, where she is well-known by customers for her friendliness and because she sells her fruits and vegetables for affordable prices. As a result, Vazira’s business generates a stable yet considerable income for her family. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Now is the prime season in which to sell fruits and vegetables, and her goods are (not surprisingly) in high demand. For this reason, she is seeking to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables in order to re-stock her store and to thereby expand her business. Accordingly, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 1,500 Somoni ($450), which she will repay in 8 months. In turn, she hopes to generate additional income in order to pay for her children’s university fees and, with your help, this will be possible. Vazira would like to thank everyone for supporting her.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>165854</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits &amp;

She is married and has three children, all of whom are in school. Her husband is currently unemployed, which is why her business is the main source of income for her family. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;At the picture Ibodat and her friend Vazira are trading alongside one another, that is why they have been pictured together. Ibodat is standing to the right side and Vazira to the left.&#13;&#10;As previously stated, Ibodat is a market vendor. Indeed, for more than ten years, she has been selling fruits and vegetables, including apricots, apples, strawberries, tomatoes, and cucumbers, in the central local market. Her oldest son helps Ibodat with the business. Ibodat begins her workday early each morning at 5:00 a.m. In practice, she buys vegetables and fruits from the local farmers, and she then sells such produce in the market, where she is well-known among the local shoppers because of her friendliness and the fact that she sells her fruits and vegetables for reasonable prices. Accordingly, Ibodat’s business generates a stable, considerable income for her family. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Now, it is the prime season in which to sell fruits and vegetables, and (not surprisingly) her goods are in great demand. In addition, she wants to expand her business in order to generate even greater income to cover the higher education expenses that her darling children will soon need. For this reason, she is planning to purchase more fresh fruits and vegetables to sell in the market, and in order to do so she is seeking a loan in the amount of 1,500 Somoni ($450), to be repaid within 8 months. She asks that you lend your support to a dedicated mother so that she can make her children’s dreams a reality because, with your help, this will be possible.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>165852</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits

Pamela and her husband live in Kisumu, Kenya.  Pamela has taken and successfully repaid three microfinance loans from KMET.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She began selling clothing door-to-door in 1999 and has since expanded her business.  She currently rents the shop seen in this picture in which she sells clothes-making materials, shoes, purses, ties and other clothing items.  She also employs a full-time tailor to meet her customers’ demands.  Pamela is a community health worker trained in home-based care by KMET.  She is, thus, well-known within her community for her health-care work.  In addition, the central location of her shop and her many years of doing good business within the community has gained her a good reputation and a wide customer base.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her business has done quite well due to the added advantage of access to loan funds; she has combined the additional money with hard work and perseverance in order to increase her stock and materials and build a successful income-generating business.  Pamela is proud of her accomplishments and that she is now able to contribute to paying household expenses. She requires US $800 to increase her stock of ready-made supplies to keep up with the growing demand.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#13;&#10;Disclaimer: Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses. Lenders to this entrepreneur should be aware that this loan may represent a higher default risk, and should be willing to accept this additional risk in making their loan.&lt;/i&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>164998</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

She and her husband run a stand that recharges home batteries for the people in her community. There are many houses in her community that still have no any electricity, so the people in that area use a home battery to generate electricity. When the batteries run out, they have to come over to Mrs. In S. to ask for recharging.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;With this business activity, In S. and her husband can typically earn at least $4 each day in revenue. They have now requested for a loan to purchase a machine to use for recharging batteries. With the new machine, she and her husband can recharge more batteries each day.&lt;/P&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>165000</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Electronics

She is a tailor, working out of her home each day sewing traditional Khmer clothing and making additions and repairs to older clothing. She earns $2 USD per day. Her husband is a government official in the local office. These positions are often grossly underpaid, as evidenced by the $2 USD he earns per day. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Even with their meager salaries, the couple supports five children. The oldest works as a motor-taxi driver to support his family, also earning $2 USD per day on average. They need to develop additional sources of income if they are to continue to support their large family. Even dual incomes are rarely enough to support families in poorer countries like Cambodia.&lt;/P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Lea C. would like to buy a motorbike for her second oldest son  to

She is relatively new to the business, having only started it two years ago and is earning $2 USD per day. Her husband is a construction worker. Unfortunately, his work is transient, taking him from village to village throughout the province, and often keeping him away from his family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;They have a total of eight children. Five of these children are still in school, an impressive feat for a large, poor family like their own. Two of the children are old enough to work and add an additional $4 USD per day to the family income. One of their sons wants to start working part-time as a motor-taxi driver to do his part to help. Vorng P. would like to be able to better provide for her family by buying a motorbike for him to use.&lt;/P&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>165006</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Motorcycle

She runs a small grocery store out of the front of her home in Siem Reap Province. This is not uncommon as most Khmer homes are actually built with the expectation that the front will become a store. She does quite well, receiving business from all around her district. She earns $10 US per day in revenue or total sales. Her husband, Chem Seoun, raises pigs and earns significantly less at $3 US per day. Both of them work from home where they can often see their nine children. As of right now, five of the kids still go to school every day. One of the older children is a semi-truck driver. Eao P. has been working on a business plan with her son to start a trucking business that will transport sand and dirt to construction sites.

She joined TYM in 2002. She is a hard working, nimble person. Since the beginning, she has discussed with her husband about investing in farming livestock. Before joining TYM fund, they used to raise only one pig running with the purpose of not to waste leftover food from their meals. With the fund from TYM, they have built new pig pen and take it seriously as a business. They have pigs for breeding and pigs for meat. They also raise chickens and ducks. Her family situation has improved a lot compared to before. Today, beside farming livestock, they also trade &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betel_nut &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;cau&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.

Trước đây khi chưa có vốn gia đình chị chỉ nuôi 1 con lợn với mục đích khỏi lãng phí những thức ăn thừa của gia đình. khi tham gia vào Quỹ vay vốn, gia đình chị đã mở rộng chuồng trại và việc chăn nuôi quy mô hơn, nuôi lợn nái và lợn thịt, ngoài ra chị cùng chồng bàn bạc nuôi thêm gà, vịt.  Mạnh giạn làm theo suy nghĩ đó gia đình chị đã khá lên rất nhiều so với trước. Hiện nay ngoài việc chăn nuôi gia đình chị còn đầu tư thêm vốn vào buôn cau, việc buôn bán cau cũng rất thuận tiện bởi vì đó là một mặt hàng không thể thiếu trong mỗi gia đình người Việt Nam khi có công việc.Với việc vay vốn phát triển kinh tế gia đình chị đã mua sắm được nhiều trang thiết bị cần thiết phục vụ cho gia đình, ti vi, xe máy ....Thu nhập bình quân 3.000.000đ/ tháng.Vòng vốn tiếp

Her husband, Saom Kean, works day to day beside her as they struggle to raise their children. Together they can earn only $2.50 US per day on average. They have seven children, three of whom are already married. Only one child is still in school, and the other three who remain unmarried farm with their parents. For poor farmers, children serve as a kind of guarantee or security. When Soy K. is too old to work she wants to have built a business her children can continue and that also allows them to take care of her. Her loan will go towards buying a small tractor which she will use to plow her farmland each season; she will also be able to leave this investment to her children, who will continue to work as farmers. Soy also has plans to expand into livestock once she can afford the pigs. She is pictured here with a neighbor&apos;s pig.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>165030</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

One of the reasons for her success is high sales to people who buy offerings for the temple each day. Her husband is also a hard worker, doing electrical and mechanical work on cars.

Selling fish has been a stable source of income for the family; however, it is a business with much competition. Ear&apos;s husband must go to the market early every morning to sell his fish while they are still fresh; after selling the fish, he has no work for the remainder of the day.

She depends on her husband, Vun Pat, to provide for her and for their three children who still live at home; Vun&apos;s business is recharging batteries. These large batteries (similar to car batteries) are used to power lights in places with no electricity. He earns the equivalent of $4 US per day. The family actually has six children, but three of them are married and live outside the family home. The oldest child living at home is a construction worker and contributes to the family income. Puch Y. recently came into possession of some farmland, but needs cows to plow it. Once it has been plowed, she and her older children will plant their first rice crop. If they can produce food for themselves, their cost of living will decrease, allowing them to save money in other areas.

They are all in school. For the past 15 years, she has been selling bitenge, large pieces of fabric with colorful prints on them used by Ugandans to make clothing of all kinds.  She buys 40 or 50 bitenge at a time from importers at 20,000/= each (Ugandan shillings, about $12 US), and sells them at 25,000/=.  She sells bitenge from her home, but also takes them to big offices or “everywhere she can find customers.”  Although sales vary, she says that she usually sells between 20 and 30 bitenge a week, and on payday, can sell them all in one day.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;She has been a member of MCDT for about six years and has received over 10 loans.  With this loan, Rosemary can increase her business by stocking more high-quality bitenge to sell.  It will also help her to pay for the basic necessities for her family: school fees, rent, food, and medicine.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1175</funded_amount><paid_amount>1175</paid_amount><image><id>165054</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Her husband died in 2000, but even before that, she had her own business selling bitenge, fabric printed with colourful patterns that are tailored and worn by people all over Uganda.  &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;She sells bitenge from her home, buying them from people who import them from Congo for 10,000/= (Ugandan shillings, about $6) each and selling them for 15,000-20,000/=.  When she gets the money, she buys about 50 at a time to keep in stock, an inventory that she usually sells in about two weeks.  She likes this business, she says, because “it doesn’t give her a headache,” allowing her time for church and to look after her children. &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;She joined MCDT in 2004 which provided the capital to increase her investment in her business.  This will be her eleventh loan. With a new loan, she will add to her inventory of bitenge.  “It helps me a lot to survive in the city.”</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1600</funded_amount><paid_amount>1600</paid_amount><image><id>165058</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Increase inventory</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Kampala</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.315556 32.565556</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>112</partner_id><posted_date>2008-06-02T15:20:16Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1600</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Betty</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Hadija</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Grace</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Florence</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Justine</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-23T07:00:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>UGX</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>2600000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1600</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>650000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>650000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>650000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>650000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>400</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>400</amount><local_amount>650000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T01:17:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>650400</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>275469</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>400</amount><local_amount>650000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T01:18:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>650400</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>305024</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>400</amount><local_amount>650000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-24T07:34:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>650400</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>335982</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>400</amount><local_amount>650000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-28T07:50:37Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>650400</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>369815</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Micro Credit Development Trust SACCO (MCDT) - Oct 23, 2008)</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-06-09T18:03:08Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-10-28T07:50:37Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>50455</id><name>Grace Ddamba’S Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Grace D. is a 30-year-old married mother of five children.

Passion fruit juice is also popular.  In her shop, she has two refrigerators so people can buy cold sodas.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;Grace and her group have received multiple loans in the past, which she says have helped her keep her children consistently in school.  With a new loan, she will be able to add on to her business.  Currently, at the end of the day, she is sold out.  With a loan, she will be able to keep more beverages in stock so she can sell more drinks each day and make the business more profitable.  &#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Ultimately, her goals are to build a house and to help her children go on to university.  In the meantime, the loan helps her to take care of all her day-to-day needs.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>575</funded_amount><paid_amount>575</paid_amount><image><id>165062</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Soft Drinks</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To increase beverages in stock to sell</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Kampala</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.315556 32.565556</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>112</partner_id><posted_date>2008-06-03T05:00:09Z</posted_date><loan_amount>575</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Grace</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Susan</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Mary</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Berna</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Rosemary</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-26T20:48:14Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>UGX</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>900000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>575</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-26T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-26T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>150000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>95.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>95.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>95.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>95.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>95.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>95.85</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>150260.87</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-26T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T01:17:07Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>156096</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>278228</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>150260.87</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-26T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T01:18:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>156096</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>307712</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>150260.87</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-26T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-27T07:27:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>156096</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>338809</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>150260.87</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-26T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-28T07:51:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>156096</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>372134</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Micro Credit Development Trust SACCO (MCDT) -

Joyce, 50, is the chairperson of the Kyosiga Women’s group in Kayunga. She is both a farmer and a business woman, selling ladies&apos; clothes (mostly underclothes) to women in their offices, hospitals, schools and homes as a side business since 1990. Joyce buys her inventory from Kampala, mostly on Thursdays and Mondays every week. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a farmer, Joyce grows beans, potatoes, and cassava and sells her crops to tenders, who supply this food to schools and usually pay her each week. At times when the season is not favorable for her, Joyce buys crops from fellow farmers and then supplies them to her customers.

Edward has a retail shop that has been running since 1991. He is 31 years and is married with 3 children. He cares for his relatives, including his wife&apos;s parents and his in the village.  He would like a loan to help him buy more goods like sugar, cooking oil, soap, rice, and maize flour for his shop.  Since he buys in small quantities, he usually buys the goods from Nazigo and Kayunga. &#13;&#10;His dream is to transform his shop into a wholesale business in a few years to come and, with this change, he will be able to buy in large quantities from Jinja, where the prices are much lower than in Kayunga and Nazigo, though transport is slightly high. In the shop, he is helped by his wife and together they are determined to make their dream come true.&#13;&#10;M.

James is a teacher by profession, teaching at Mubanda Primary School in Kayunga. He is 36 years old and is married with four children, all in school, in addition to 2 orphans that belong to his late brother. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The income of a primary school teacher in his locality is not sufficient for all the necessities in his home and so James started buying and selling coffee beans. He buys dried coffee beans from farmers and takes them to the coffee factory for removal of the husks. Customers are usually at the factory ready to buy. He uses the husks for manure on his farm but he can also sell off the excess. James also buys fresh coffee beans from farmers and dries them at home, thereby lowering his costs. He also books orders from those coffee plantations that are yet to be ready by paying a deposit to the owners. This business has allowed him to support his family and to buy pigs and chickens for his wife to keep at home for their farm. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;James is a good client of Pearl Microfinancing in the Kyosiga Women’s group, making his repayments promptly. Now he needs a loan to buy more coffee seeds. He employs workers to move around on bicycles to the villages to purchase the coffee beans, but at times they are not fast because of the hills and his dream is to buy a motorcycle to make the process much easier.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2400</funded_amount><paid_amount>2400</paid_amount><image><id>165080</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To increase an inventory of coffee beans.</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Kayunga</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>1 32.866667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>84</partner_id><posted_date>2008-07-07T00:30:11Z</posted_date><loan_amount>2400</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>James</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Ivan</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Francis</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Yokana</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Peter</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Isa</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Christopher</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Stomme</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Nuwa</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Dan</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Budala</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Jimmy</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Edward</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-07-22T19:14:51Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>UGX</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>3900000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>2400</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>975000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>975000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>975000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>975000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>600</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>600</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>600</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>600</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>600</amount><local_amount>975000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-22T09:00:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T01:23:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>975600</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>303876</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>600</amount><local_amount>975000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-22T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-23T07:22:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>975600</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>334726</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>600</amount><local_amount>975000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-22T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-29T07:16:03Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>975600</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>369108</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Pearl Microfinance Limited -

Godfrey, 30, has a &quot;boda boda&quot; (a term used for the motorcycle business in Kayunga).

Right now she needs a loan to buy another bale of clothes because most of her funds have been spent on school fees now that the children are reporting for school.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>4375</funded_amount><paid_amount>4375</paid_amount><image><id>165103</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used Clothing</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To increase an inventory of used clothes.</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Rubaga</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.3 32.55</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>84</partner_id><posted_date>2008-08-02T04:10:13Z</posted_date><loan_amount>4375</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Fatuma</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Faridah</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Edith</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Judith</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Alice</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Sarah</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Robinah</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Cissy</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Mathius</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Ivan</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Shifah</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Harriet</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-08-23T20:57:21Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>UGX</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>7100000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>4375</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1775000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1775000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1775000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1775000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1093.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1093.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1093.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1093.75</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>1094</amount><local_amount>1775405.71</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-24T07:39:04Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1778844</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>335745</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>1094</amount><local_amount>1775405.71</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-29T07:16:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1778844</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>369923</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Pearl Microfinance Limited -

This is 42-year-old Lulu N.. She is widowed and has 3 children, ages 9, 18, and 22. In 2001 Lulu established her liquor store business. Working 7 days a week and 9 to 12 hours a day, she earns about US$40 every month from this business. She is assisted by her brother and 1 employee. Lulu has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan from SELFINA, and she now requires a new loan in order to purchase additional stocks of beer and soft drinks in bulk. In the future, Lulu plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. &lt;P&gt;It is said that Coca Cola® is one of the most recognized symbols or &quot;words&quot; in the world. And it’s true. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of &quot;bar&quot; selling Coke, Fanta, and Guinness. (Pepsi has made it to most African capitals but not to the rural areas, but I’m sure they’re working on it!) The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing: a very cheap marketing tool!

All the members dream of having their own house. Some of them belonged to another group before but they decided to form a new one and start from the beginning. They are all very hard-working people who want to bring benefits to their families.&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;The Committee of Entrepreneuring women is a program carried out by Fundación Paraguaya that targets groups of enterprising women who create a village bank through which they receive assistance in terms of loans. The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities that enable them to live with dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women committee members the energy and motivation to reach success.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Among the businesses they run are grocery stores and businesses selling CDs, fruit, vegetables, clothing, drinks, lingerie, cosmetics, and food. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The money provided by the credit will be used for the purchase of  sugar, rice, fruits, vegetables, drinks, and fabric.

Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>The Committee of Entrepreneuring women is a program carried out by Fundación Paraguaya that targets groups of enterprising women who create a village bank through which they receive assistance in terms of loans. The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities that enable them to live with dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women committee members the energy and motivation to reach success.&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;The committee “Rincon Poty” (Flowers’ corner) is proud to be in its fourth cycle.  They have been working with Fundacion Paraguaya for one year.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In 2007, there was an epidemic that affected many people in the whole country. A very affected area was the neighborhood where these ladies live.  As a result, four members of the committee got dengue and yellow fever. Since they were not able to work, the generation of income in their families slowed down. The whole group organized different events in the neighborhood in order to raise funds to help the ladies. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The businesses these ladies run are: grocery stores, mini-restaurants, sewing shops, and sales of cosmetics, clothing, remedies, jewelry, and chicken. The money provided by the credit will be invested in: sugar, flour, pasta, winter clothing, fabric, remedies etc.

B. is originally from Cantón Cojxac, in the town and department of Totonicapán. He works as a weaver and came to Asociación ASDIR in order to be able to expand the business he owns. He tells us that he has worked in weaving for over 20 years, making a traditional lightweight fabric. His brother started this business because he traveled frequently to the Panajachel department of Sololá and it occurred to him that he could market such a product there. G. B. worked for his brother for a while, but over time he thought of having his own shop. This was made possible through a loan from the BANDESA bank. He currently has four looms at home and two more in his worker’s houses. With the loan from ASDIR, he plans to buy two more looms and more materials. &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;El es originario del Cantón Cojxac, del municipio y departamento de Totonicapán, quien labora como tejedor, acudió a la institución para poder ampliar el negocio que maneja. Nos manifiesta que desde hace 20 Años que empezó a laborar en la tejeduría, produciendo mantas laboreadas tipicas, el cual fue una  iniciativa de su  hermano quien viajaba mucho al municipio de  Panajachel departamento de  Sololá,  le surgio la  la idea que en este lugar se podia comercializar  este producto, por una temporada estuvo laborando para su hermano,   en el transcurso del tiempo pensó crear  su propio taller, el cual le funcionó gracias a un crédito que el Banco que en sus siglas  BANDESA le proporcionó y logro  iniciar el negocio propio , actualmente tiene cuatro telares, dos instalados en casa de habitación y otros dos en casa de sus trabajadores. Con el crédito que ASDIR le va a proporcionar  tiene la visión de implementar otros dos telares y compra de más materiales.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>165196</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Textiles</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Working

Lopéz is orginally from Guatemala City, the capital. He currently resides in Cantón Chotacaj, Totonicapán. He got his start by working for an auto body and painting shop in Guatemala City, but later married in Totonicapán, where he now lives. He opened his own auto body and paint workshop. He later noticed that the business didn’t have much income because there weren’t enough vehicles in the town, so he didn’t have that business for very long. He asked a friend in Quetzaltenango for a job in a shop that made metal structures. He worked there for 5 years, after which he took the initiative to open his own business. He opened a shop in the county of Cotacaj, where his products gained wide acceptance since there were none like them in the region. With the loan he is requesting, he plans to increase his work on metallic roofs (synthetic ball courts, salons, etc.). &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Originario de la Ciudad Capital, actualmente con residencia en el Cantón Chotacaj, Totonicapán, Inicialmente laboraba para una empresa de  Enderezado y Pintura de vehículo en su ciudad natal, luego contrajo matrimonio en el municipio de Totonicapán  donde actualmente  reside, en donde  instaló un local para el enderezado y pintura de vehículo pero tiempo más adelante  observó que en el lugar  el negocio no tenía mucho ingreso porque la cantidad de vehículos no era suficiente,  no muy tarde dejó este negocio. Pidió trabajo a un amigo en Quetzaltenango,  Guatemala que laboraba en  estructuras metálicas donde laboro  5 años, después tuvo la iniciativa de emprender su propio negocio, instaló su local de trabajo en el cantón chotacaj, donde este producto  tuvo una aceptación ya que la misma no existía en el medio .

Primavera Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>The Committee of Entrepreneuring Women is a program carried out by Fundación Paraguaya which targets groups of enterprising women who create a village bank through which they receive assistance in terms of loans. The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities which enable them to live in dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women the energy and motivation to reach success.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;The Comite Primavera (Spring Group) is today in its sixth cycle. All the members of the group are very responsible and punctual with their payments. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Among the businesses these ladies run are: sewing shops, grocery stores, milk sales, fruits, vegetables, drinks, clothing, cheese and others. The money provided by the credit will be used to purchase sugar, rice, fruits, vegetables, drinks and fabrics.

With the goal of finding a better job, Justo and his wife decided to try their luck and travelled to Argentina. There they stayed 10 years. Justo worked as a labourer and his wife worked as a house maid.  But after those 10 years they decided to return to Paraguay with a business idea and the wish to invest in their home country.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today the couple owns a bar where people can come and relax, have a few drinks and a meal. The bar has given them the opportunity to provide their children with an education and the nutrition they need. Thanks to their efforts and good management skills, Justo and his wife see their business in a state of constant growth.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The funds that are requested will be invested in the purchase of drinks, flour, meats, eggs, milk, and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;El señor Justo tiene 48 años de edad y su esposa la señora Teodolina 49.

Con el fin de buscar mejores oportunidades laborales, Justo y su esposa decidieron probar suerte y viajaron  a la Argentina.

Luego de 10 anos decidieron volver al Paraguay con ideas emprendedoras y con ganas de invertir en su país.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Actualmente la pareja es dueña de un bar donde las personas van a relajarse y a tomar unos tragos o comer algo.

The group is now in the 4th cycle of the Mujeres Emprendedoras (Enterprising Women) program and to date they have an average line of credit of 746.000 gs per member.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The group was created because Amelia learned about the project through an ad in the local media and came to our office where she was given all of the information on the Mujeres Emprendedoras group at Fundación Paraguaya.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Amelia was very quickly able to assemble 15 women, which is the minimum number of members required to form a group, and after going through the training sessions she established this group of working women who have hopes to progress. Today it is obvious that the women are very happy to be a part of her group and that the group&apos;s members all come from the same district.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;The group&apos;s main goal is to capitalize on their internal savings as soon as possible through their businesses that provide income such as making food, running raffles and other businesses. This will enable them to have extra money to pay their dues in case anything sudden happens that will prevent them from paying.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;They will invest the loans that they receive in the purchase of products to make chipas (local food that is very commonly eaten in Paraguay) such as starch, oil, cheese and also to purchase, herbs, sugar, soft drinks  and another group of them who sell clothing need the loans to purchase used clothing wholesale because this enables them to get lower prices.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by a Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;El comité está integrado por 15 señoras trabajadoras del barrio San Miguel de la ciudad de Caacupé, el grupo se encuentra actualmente en el 4to. Ciclo del programa Mujeres Emprendedoras, y a la fecha todas manejan una línea de crédito promedio de gs. 746.000 por cada integrante.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;El comité fue formado gracias a que la señora Amelia tuvo conocimiento del proyecto a través de una publicidad en uno de los medios locales y se acerco a la oficina, dónde recibió toda la información acerca del Comité de Mujeres Emprendedaras de la Fundación Paraguaya.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;En poco tiempo la señora Amelia llego a juntar a las 15 señoras, que es el mínimo de integrantes requerido para formar el comité; así es como luego de las reuniones de capacitación se formaliza este grupo de hermosas señoras trabajadoras y deseosas de progresar. Hoy día manifiestan que están muy contentas de ser parte de su grupo además de que el mismo está formado por vecinas del mismo barrio.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;El principal objetivo de este grupo es la de capitalizar en la brevedad posible sus ahorros interno a través de actividades que genere ganancias como ser feria de comida, rifas (sorteos) entre otras actividades, esto les permitirá tener un extra para pagar las cuotas en caso de surgir algún imprevisto y que imposibilite pagar la cuota.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Los préstamos que recibieran desean invertirlo en la compra de productos para la elaboración de chipas (comida típica muy consumida en Paraguay) como ser almidón, aceite, queso, como así también para la compra de yerba, azúcar, gaseosas, otro grupo de señora que se dedican a la venta de ropa necesitan el crédito para la compra de ropas usadas en forma mayorista ya que esto les permite obtener un precio mas bajo.&lt;p&gt;</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2775</funded_amount><paid_amount>2775</paid_amount><image><id>165260</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

Koe´ju Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language></languages><texts><es>&lt;p&gt;This committee is composed of 15 hard working women who the majority are business women that sell yucca breads. The group is currently in the fifth stage of their program for women.  The union of this committee is largely thanks to the efforts of Gloria C. who sought out each of these women in their homes and invited them to come to partake in an information session in their home.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is how the Koe&apos;ju Committee was born, in our second aboriginal language Guarani the name means &quot;Sunrise&quot;. This committee is composed of 15 women of which 7 sell yucca breads (a traditional food in Paraguay widely popular and resembling cheese bread).  Three of the women run grocery stores and the others sell clothing. They are all neighbours in the Kennedy region in the city of Caaupe.  One of the virtues of this committee is the interest and loyalty in the rules and regulations of the program, and in the timeliness of the monthly payments. These women also hold a capital savings thanks to the work they carry out every weekend in the markets, for special events, sporting events, and any other occassion.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All of the members receive an equal sum of money and they will invest it in the purchase of ingredients and merchandise for their sales. The committee&apos;s objective for the short term is to improve the image of the region by keeping the public patios clean and by painting the fences along the streets and also to remodel the small plaza, in need of repair and repainting.  In addition, the play structures need to be repaired so that the children might have their recreational area to play in safely.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;El comité está compuesto por 15 señoras trabajadoras que en su mayoría son comerciantes, la mayoría de ellas se dedican a la elaboración y venta de chipas, actualmente el grupo ya está en su 5to. ciclo del programa comité de mujeres. La unión de este comité se debió en gran parte por la buena predisposición de la señora Gloria C. quien fue la buscó a cada señora de sus casas y las invitó para la reunión de información que se realizó en su casa.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Así nace el Comité Koe`ju,  que en nuestro segundo idioma nativo el Guaraní significa Amanecer. Este comité está integrado por 15 señoras de las cuales 7 se dedican a la venta de chipas (comida típica del Paraguay muy consumida parecida a un pan con queso), 3 poseen despensas y las otras se dedican a la venta de ropas. Todas son vecinas del barrio Kennedy de la ciudad de Caaupé, una de las virtudes de este comité es el interés y el cumplimiento de las normas y reglamento del programa, además de la puntualidad en los pagos de sus cuotas. Estas mujeres poseen además un interesante ahorro de dinero gracias a las actividades que realizan cada fin de semana como  ferias de comidas, rifas, torneos deportivos, entre otras actividades.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Todas las integrantes reciben un promedio de gs. 580.000 y lo invierten para la compra de insumos y mercaderías para sus ventas. El comité tiene como objetivo a corto plazo la de mejorar la imagen del barrio con la limpieza de los patios baldíos, veredas y pintar los cordones de las calles al igual que embellecer la pequeña plaza del barrio que necesita pintura y reparación de los juegos para que sus hijos tengan un lugar donde recrearse sanamente y fuera de peligros.&lt;p&gt;</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2150</funded_amount><paid_amount>2150</paid_amount><image><id>165281</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

El Progresso is a town that is located in a very remote area in the mountains of the region of Solola.  The ladies have to walk an hour and a half to arrive at the first location of &quot;pick ups&quot;, the main method of public transportation of this region.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Sadly, this town was violently affected during the civil war.  Nevertheless, little by little non-governmental organizations and governmental institutions have begun to help this group of people to develop and to increase their standards of living through different types of assistance.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Comunicadoras Mayan is a formidable group.  They have two loans with the institution and they have never been late with their payments.  It is incredible that people who live in a so remote an area and with so few opportunities for work have such an excellent credit record.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;The majority of the group works in the textile sector.  Many are weavers.  They weave the traditional suits using the waist loom technique.  Other ladies work in the breeding of animals.  They raise chickens and hogs.  Some ladies have two businesses.  For example Ramos X. weaves traditional clothes and makes jeweled necklaces.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;When it was asked of them if they faced competition, they responded yes.  However they noted that, due to working a long time in the business, they already have specific buyers to whom they sell.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;The ladies think that the loans have helped them a lot, because this has been the only infusion of capital that they have received in their life.  Some say that without this loan their business would never have been able to do well.  &#13;&#10;  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;En el remoto pueblo de Pujujuil 1, caserio el Progreso habitan las señoras que pertenecen al banco comunal Comunicadoras Mayas. El Progreso es un pueblo que queda en un área muy retirada en las montañas del departamento de Solola. Las señoras tienen que caminar una hora y media para llegar al primer paradero de “pick ups”, el método principal de transporte público de esta región. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Lamentablemente, este pueblo fue violentamente afectado durante la guerra civil. Sin embargo, poco a poco ONGs e instituciones gubernamentales han empezado a ayudar a este grupo de gente a desarrollar e incrementar sus niveles de vida por medio de distintos tipos de asistencia. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Comunicadoras Mayas es un grupo formidable. Ellas llevan dos préstamos con la institución y nunca se han atrasado con sus pagos. Es increíble como gente que vive en un área tan remota y con tan pocas oportunidades de trabajo tenga un record crediticio tan excelente. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;La mayoría del grupo trabaja en el sector textil. Muchas son tejedoras. Ellas tejen los trajes tradicionales utilizando la técnica de telar de cintura. Otras señoras trabajan en la crianza de animales. Ellas crían pollos y cerdos. Algunas señoras tienen dos negocios. Por ejemplo Ramos X. teje ropa tradicional y elabora joyas a base de mostacilla.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Cuando se les preguntó a las señoras si ellas percibían la competencia. Ellas respondieron que si, sin embargo ellas especificaron que debido a que llevan mucho tiempo en el negocio, ellas ya tienen compradores específicos a quien venderles. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;Las señoras piensan que el crédito las ha ayudado mucho porque este ha sido la única infusión de capital que ellas han recibido durante su vida. Algunas dicen que sin este préstamo sus negocios nunca hubieran podido salir adelante.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>3600</funded_amount><paid_amount>3600</paid_amount><image><id>165310</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Textiles</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>To

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Tuy S. is 50 years old. She runs two complementary businesses: pig raising and rice wine making. The reason these businesses are often combined in Cambodia is because the leftover rice mash from making the wine makes excellent pig feed. Therefore, anyone who makes rice wine can also afford to raise pigs cheaply. With her combined businesses, Tuy S. earns US$3 a day. Her husband is a local fisherman who does well for himself fishing in the province&apos;s many lakes and rivers. He earns US$5 a day. Tuy S. and her husband have eight children, the oldest of whom got married just recently. Two others are also grown up and currently work at a hotel earning US$120 per month. Tuy S. is asking for a loan, which she would mostly use for her older children&apos;s daily commute to the provincial capital for work. Specifically, Tuy S. hopes to buy them a motorbike to make the commute easier and cheaper.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>165350</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Motorcycle

She sells soft drinks by the roadside from a large cooler earning US$5 a day. Her husband works as a motorbike mechanic and gets a lot of business each day. His income averages about US$8 a day. The young couple has two children who are still too young to attend school. Veng has several business plans for the future. She needs a loan to be able to purchase mechanic tools to help her husband in his business, as well as a plot of land to sell later once prices go up. Veng expects a rise in land prices, since the volume of tourism in the province is growing at an exponential rate.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1100</funded_amount><paid_amount>1100</paid_amount><image><id>165353</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Motorcycle

He has three children; his daughter is married and lives separately with her husband, and his sons live with him.  They are married, and each wants to make a contribution to the family budget, but up to now Ghufron K. alone has been shouldering all the expenses. With a large family and only one person working, it is difficult to support the family. He looked to several banks for loans, but he felt the best about Microinvest&apos;s good conditions. Once he received a loan, he began renting another minibus to drive and loaned his own minibus to his eldest son. Now, if business is good he hopes to remodel several parts of the minibus to make room for more people so he can make a bit more money. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Гуфрону 58 лет, он работает водителем  по городу. У него 3 детей, дочь замужем живет отдельно с мужем. Сыновья  живут с ним. Они женаты и что бы покормит семью каждый из них хочет внести какой то вклад в семейный бюджет, до сих пор все затраты нес Кодиров Гуфрон. Теперь, когда  его семья очень большая, работая  только  один   такую большую семью будет трудно прокормить. Он обращался в несколько банки, но хорошие условия   Микроинвест  были ему по душе. Получив кредит, арендуют  еще один микроавтобус для транспортировки людей, а свой  микроавтобус он одолжил старшему сыну. Надеясь на хороший бизнес, в дальнейшем он переоборудует машину еще на несколько мест, для того чтобы помещалось по больше людей, что позволит заработать немного больше

She runs a school canteen at Bugolo Junior School, ½ km away from where she lives in Lugala, a rural district of Kampala. She makes items such as samosas, half-cakes (a kind of fried dough), and pancakes (small patties like banana bread) to sell to the pupils.  She has operated the canteen for the past 15 years and found it to be a profitable business. Before that, she was a teacher, but the pay was too low to pay school fees for her children, food and other expenses.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With a loan, she would like to add lined exercise books, pencils and other stationery items to her canteen.  If she makes enough profit, she would like to get a small shop for herself rather than at school.  At school, she explains, if you retire, someone else takes over the business.  Her long-range plan is to build a house in the village so that if she retires, she will have somewhere to stay. She has paid back more than 5

Mugide’S Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Justine M. is a married woman of 28. She used to be a math and science teacher, but the pay was so low, and often late, that she left the profession to open a school canteen. For the past year, she has operated a canteen at a new private primary school of 200 students. She sells lined exercise books, pencils, pens, as well as snacks such as groundnuts, chapattis and bread. She has found this to be a profitable business. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She lives and works in Masanafu, a trading center near the western outskirts of Kampala, and has to travel to the city centre to purchase items for her canteen.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With a loan, Justine will be able to purchase items to sell and pay school fees for her three younger sisters. She plans to open a big shop as well as save money for future purposes. She hopes one day to build her own school. She says that if people can find ways to support her, it will help her business.&#13;&#10;Justine is repaying her second loan.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>325</funded_amount><paid_amount>325</paid_amount><image><id>165426</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cafe</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase

Luwaga&apos;s Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Agnes is a leader of a group with 4 members. She is 45 years, single, with 5 children between the ages of 3 and 20 years. Three of them are still in school. The community she resides in and works in is semi-urban, within a slum and a wetland. The area is prone to flooding in the rainy season. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She has been selling second-hand clothes for the last 15 years, which she purchases in bales to sell at wholesale and retail. She has a stall where she displays the clothes. Sometimes she looks for clothes to purchase in the weekly markets that occur on different days.  Other times, Agnes goes from door-to-door in order to sell her clothes.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Her main challenges include high transport costs; the flooded areas, which make clients` homes inaccessible; and losses due to substandard and damaged clothes that she sometimes finds in the bales of clothes.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She has been able to increase her stock and meet the needs of the family. She is requesting a loan so she can purchase more clothes to sell.

With this business, she can typically earn around US$10 per day. Her married daughter (pictured in the photo) works as a cook and rents out a part of her house to people from other families. Sometimes, her daugher also assists in selling vegetables at the market, only 40% of which she then keeps to herself. &#13;&#10;Mrs. Prum S. currently needs a loan of US$1,000 to repair a part of her

She obtains her supplies in her village, and sometimes in Cotonou for certain urgent needs. Mrs. Clémence B. is married and has 4 children. She is asking for this loan for a refrigerator enabling her to sell drinks and ice cubes, and also for the purchase of bags of charcoal to strengthen her business in the future.

MCDT. They are repaying their fourth loan. She is 30 years of age and a widow who has just lost her husband through an accident. He left her with 2 biological children 8 and 4 years old, and his own 16-year-old daughter. She left school due to pregnancy. Both of her children attend in school. Jennifer never had any loans until she joined MCDT. The community she lives in is urban within a slum in a low-lying area.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer has  a retail shop and sells essential items and cold drinks. She acquired a refrigerator and a television set to attract more clients. She has many customers.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The main challenge is the flooded surroundings during the rainy season. The benefits of having her retail shop include being able to take her children to school, increased working capital, and providing for her family. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; With a loan, Jennifer plans to acquire a public pay telephone. Her daughter will operate the phone, and this will increase their income. She also plans to build a house on the plot of land that her late husband left.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1250</funded_amount><paid_amount>1250</paid_amount><image><id>165469</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Plans to acquire a public pay telephone</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Kampala</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.315556 32.565556</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>112</partner_id><posted_date>2008-06-09T11:40:09Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1250</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Jennifer</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Robinah</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Nulu</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Esther</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower><borrower><first_name>Safina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-06-23T16:49:19Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>UGX</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>2000000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1250</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-07-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-08-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-09-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>333333.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>208.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>208.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>208.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>208.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>208.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>208.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>209</amount><local_amount>334400</local_amount><processed_date>2008-07-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T01:17:07Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>339416</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>275471</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>209</amount><local_amount>334400</local_amount><processed_date>2008-08-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-08-29T01:18:28Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>339416</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>305026</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>209</amount><local_amount>334400</local_amount><processed_date>2008-09-23T09:00:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-09-24T07:34:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>339416</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>335984</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>207</amount><local_amount>331200</local_amount><processed_date>2008-10-23T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-10-28T07:50:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>336168</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>369817</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Micro Credit Development Trust SACCO (MCDT) -

Plateau. She has in her care 2 children; her husband lives in Gabon. Very early on, she began engaging in business in her hometown. After that, she established herself in Cotonou in the DANTOKPA market, where she sold tablets. The sale of medicine being banned, she abandoned this business. Currently, she has found a site to sell various products as well as fruit juice and lollipops. She is on her fourth loan, and has handled herself very well. This loan will allow her to restock her store. It is important to note that she often benefits from the support of her elder daughter in transporting certain products.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Issue d&apos;une modeste famille dame B. Aminatou est originaire de Sakété une petite ville située au Sud-est du Bénin dans le département du Plateau. Elle a à sa charge 02 enfants; son mari résident au Gabon. Très tôt elle s&apos;est lancée dans le commerce dans sa ville natale. Ensuite, elle s&apos;est installée à Cotonou dans le marché DANTOKPA où elle vendait des comprimés. La vente de médicaments étant une activité proscrite, elle a abandonné cette activité. Aujourd&apos;hui, elle a trouvé un emplacement où elle vend divers produits et également des jus de fruits et sucette. Elle est à son quatrième crédit et se comporte très bien. Ce prêt lui servira donc à ravitailler sa boutique. Notons qu&apos;elle bénéficie souvent de l&apos;appui de sa fille aînée pour l&apos;écoulement de certains produits.</fr></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>165475</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To

The five oldest are all in school.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Christine has operated a profitable grocery business for the past 7 years, selling matooke (green bananas), sweet potatoes, tomatoes, greens, fish and fruits in the market at Masanafu, a rural district of Kampala.  She buys items from the Kasubi market, where farmers transport and sell their produce at relatively low prices. In turn, she sells the produce to her neighbours and the people in her community.  She started her grocery because she needed money for school fees for her children.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With a loan, she will add new items to her business, such as charcoal.  By selling more things and different things, her business will be even more profitable. She has successfully paid back more than 5 loans.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Christine would like to achieve a high standard of living: buying clothes for the children and having a good house. She wants to have enough money for all her children to complete their studies.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1175</funded_amount><paid_amount>1175</paid_amount><image><id>165484</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

She is pictured above (after being involved in an accident). She and her husband live in Siaya, Kenya. She began her current business  selling second-hand clothes eight years ago. She specializes in both children&apos;s and women’s clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nereah attributes her success to her friendly interaction with customers and additional finance from KMET. She has applied for $600.00 to further expand her business by increasing stock of new and second-hand clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses.

Hilda’s store who for 10 years has dedicated herself to selling and renting traditional skirts. She also tailors beautiful and innovative clothing that are shown at her store. Her store is frequently visited and many “cholitas” order their colorful traditional skirts for special occasions or simply to look more beautiful from Hilda. Hilda feels very happy because she never imagined that this business that she began with little expectations would convert itself into her main source of income. Now that she has experience in this activity she hopes to expand it and is thus requesting a loan. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Eliza Wethey, Kiva

solicitada por aquellas hermosas cholitas que  adquieren  sus coloridas polleras para fechas especiales o simplemente para  lucir más bellas, Hilda se  siente muy contenta  por que jamás imagino que ese negocio que inicio  con poca expectativa se convertiría en su principal fuente de ingreso  económico.Ahora que ya tiene experiencia en ésta  actividad  desea ampliarla y es por ello que solicita un préstamo.</es></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>725</funded_amount><paid_amount>725</paid_amount><image><id>165532</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing
